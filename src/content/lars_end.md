Hello,

I'm Rei.
The daughter of Joanne and Lars.
This is going to be hard to get through.

Part of me can't believe I'm actually back here.
It's been so long.
I'm sorry I didn't come around more often.
I mean, some people here might not even know me and that's a real shame.

I don't know where to start.
I guess I could read my script, but...

Did you know my dad used to write letters?
And books?

There's a secret observation deck under the kelp facility.
He would go there every day and just write.

Due to an accident, I actually got access to all of his files and have read many of them
Every now and again, Nemo would come back online and I would get a flurry of new letters.
Many were to me.
Some were to mom.
Many were to Grampa Jeb as well.

It was clear that I was never meant to read any of them, but I did anyway.
On the one hand, I knew it was wrong.
On the other hand, I couldn't help myself.
My heart was still in Nemo.
 
Nemo has three impossible goals:
1. Study whether it is possible to transform an oceanic desert into a livable environment for plants, fish, and (somewhat importantly) humans.
2. Recycle as much plastic as possible from the southern Pacific garbage patch.
3. Track and collect all the satellites that land in the gyre.

He is the heart of Nemo.

He's never published any papers.
Never seant any of his letters even.
He's not in any videos or photos.
Yet he's the most important person to never exist.
