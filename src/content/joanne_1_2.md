# She's Just Like You

Hey Joanne,

I made a mistake.
Not one of those huge monumental mistakes that cause your entire life to spiral out of control.
A smaller one.
One so subtle that even in hindsight, I don't know what I could have done differently.

A few days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night.
I am not quite sure what the time was, maybe two or three in the morning?
It doesn't matter.
The point is that no matter how much I tossed and turned, I simply could not get back to sleep.
So I instead got up, slipped on my shoes, and started to walk while daydreaming at night.

I was truly exhausted.
It felt like my bones were moving while my muscles lagged behind, and I unconsciously swayed to and fro.
I hadn't felt that way since Rei used to wake up at a similar hour as a toddler.

Somehow, I found myself wandering along the same path.
The bench where she'd stash all her toys.
The communal kitchen where we'd make a midnight snack.
The dock where we'd dip our toes in the water.
Places where a baby could babble without waking anyone.

Now, hear me out.
We often think of the passage time as constant: minutes turn to hours, and then to days, years, and decades.
A second is always a second, no matter how we measure it.
But I really feel like there are nearly universal human experiences that contradict this notion.
The mornings after a hard night of work.
An afternoon spent deeply engrossed in a good book.
Late nights spent scrolling through the internet with an incredibly important deadline looming in the near future.

In these moments, time seems to change.
If you look at the clock and blink, hours could pass.
Or the opposite might be true: it could feel like hours betweeen each tick of the clock.

That night, while sitting at the dock and splashing with my feet, I feel like I found another one of those time warping experiences.
I could not tell you what happened next.
I guess I had a few small dreams about us.
You, me, and Jake.

Sometimes, we'd be walking and talking near the dock and suddenly, without warning, I would hear a loud splash from the water and feel a dirty shirt fall over my head.
Jake would then call out, "Come on in! The water's great!"
Of course, he had been wearing his swimming suit underneath his clothes all day, because "jammers [^ A type of athletic swim suit] were just boxers with extra compression."
We, being the "normal" ones, would also be wearing normal, dry clothes.
Stuff that would be a pain to get wet.
So I'd always fold his shirt, take of my shoes, and sit at the dock while you fussed about whether you should jump in with him or not.
You never did.

We used to just sit there and chat for hours while Jake swam in circles.
Sometimes, we'd manage to herd Jake back on to land.
Sometimes, we'd be called by my dad for dinner.
Sometimes, we'd stay there till the satellites came out.
If we were lucky, even the stars.

That night.
While I sat there alone.
The sky was so bright.
I actually had to shield my eyes from the moon.

I felt like every time I blinked, I would find a new memory I had long forgotten.
The time we accidentally ruined half the samples in the ocean lab.
The time we gave a tour to dignitaries because Mark was too busy to talk to any of them.
The time it was just the two of us.
I was lying down.
You were sitting at the edge of the dock with your feet in the water.

Then.
Well, to be honest, I don't know if that last one was a memory or a dream.
I'm still wondering which is which, because when I opened my eyes, there was actually someone sitting beside me.
She was kicking a bit in the water while leaning back on her hands, staring off into space, and mumbling softly to herself.
The only problem was that it wasn't you.
It was Rei.

And it was, what? Almost four in the morning?

In that moment, I knew what I had to do.
I had to be a good, stern father and send her back to sleep.
After all, she's a growing teenager.
She needed -- needs rest.
I was planning on sitting up, grabbing her by the hand and saying, "C'mon, let's get back to bed."

But then her hands began waving in the air, and I realized she was using her glasses [^augmented reality glasses that project monitors into space for those wearing them] to reason about a problem.
So I silently laid there, pretending to sleep while eavesdropping on the conversation she was having with herself and trying to piece together what she was working on.

Now.
You know how I'm a deeply flawed individual who basically never gets anything right?
Well, one of my many flaws is that I can never quite find an appropriate emotional response.
I should have been frustrated.
Tired and annoyed at Rei for being up at an unreasonable hour.

But I wasn't upset at all.
I don't know what I was feeling, exactly.
Maybe it was pride for my daughter who took initiative to either stay up late or get up early to solve a complex problem.
Maybe it was happiness that she hadn't started her teenage rebelious phase and was still willing to hang out with an old man like me.
Without realizing it, a smile crept up on my face and I chuckled to myself.

And I think that was it.
My mistake.

Time froze.
The waves stopped.
She turned her head to me and said, "Good. I'm glad you're awake..."
And I blinked.

Suddenly, the lights were red.

To be honest, I initially thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I blinked again.
I then rubbed at my temples and stretched, trying to wake myself up.
No matter what I did, the lights remained red.

And the lab was a mess.
Screwdrivers were strewn about
Almost every drawer was open.
I don't know why, but there were three separate keyboards on the table, all missing certain keys.
Meanwhile, Rei was humming to herself while scrambling for something, somewhere.

And it was still four in the morning!

But you know how it goes.
I just couldn't.
In that moment, I couldn't be a good father.
She's just a force of nature.

Jake always says that he loves working out.
Not the working out part.
That sucks.
The part afterwards when your muscles are jelly, but before they become sore.
The part when you can't bend down anymore to pick up a pencil because you've already used up one-hundred percent of your energy.
The part where simple things become complicated and you need to relearn how to do everything.

In those moments, you can't help but laugh at your own helplessness.
And that's what I did.
I slumped down to the floor next to the door and laughed.

Soon, I heard a thump on the table and Rei said, "I need your help."

So I stood back up and saw she had a box filled with a bunch of different tools: a soldering iron, some sort of memory drive, wires of all different colors and sizes, and so on.
Next to the box was a completely dismantled pair of glasses.
*My* glasses.
The ones I needed the next day for work.

I wish I could have been angry.
I should have put my foot down and told her that this was not acceptable.
She should have come to me *before* damaging an important piece of equipment.
She should have known not to use someone else's property for some of her own experiments.
She should have at least waited until morning when more people were in lab in the case there was some sort of accident.

But she didn't.
And I couldn't.

But I *could* at least commit to the bit.
So I sighed and covered my face with my hand to hide my amusement and said, "alright. Explain yourself."

She didn't say anything immediately and instead inched herself closer to my facewhile tilting her head to look under my hand.
During this time, her hair pooled onto the table and I silently wondered if it would get caught in a wire.
After a few seconds, she said, "Promise you won't be angry?"

"I'm already furious." I said while chuckling a bit, "Now tell me what happened."

[EDIT: I like the unknotting unknot as an analogy to understanding Rei, but I think it's still a bit clunky]
Ok.
Look.
Let's say you've got a rope and you decide to tie the two ends together to make a circle.
For the sake of the argument, we'll call this an unknotted circle, or an unknot.
Now let's say you stick that rope in your pocket and go for a run.
When you get back, the rope will be all twisted around and tangled, but if you carefully take your time, you can untangle everything back to the original circle.
That process of unknotting an unknot is precisely how it feels to decipher any conversation with Rei.
It's a bit of an agonizing process, but when it's all over, everything feels simple.
You go from, "What in the world is going on here" to "Ah, right. Simple enough." in a matter of seconds.
Or hours.
However long it takes for Rei to untangle her own web of technical issues. 

Also, yeah.
I did just throw in some topology homework to this letter [^ Actually, the unknotting problem is really fun to look into: CITE].
Sue me.
Oh, right.
You can't.
We don't have a court system.
[END EDIT]

Anyway, tangents on tangents aside, let me try to explain what was going on.

You know TAI? The *Translation* AI that comes preinstalled on all modern glasses?
Well, it does a lot of things.
It can answer just about any question by scouring the internet for you.
It can keep track of your vital information and let you know whether you need to sleep or eat.
It also translates anything anyone says around you into a language you can easily understand.

Obviously, TAI does not need to translate anything if the conversation is fully in a single language.
When it does need to translate, TAI does a pretty good job matching intonations and voice so it's sometimes hard to detect that the person is speaking a foreign language at all.
But "pretty good" is not "perfect."
It will sometimes fail to emphasize key words and phrases.
Sometimes it's vocabulary is a little verbose and can cause some misunderstandings.
Certain jokes, for example, simply do not work after being translated.

Well, we speak English.
Rei's friend speaks Japanese.
Rei wanted to speak to her friend without using TAI, so she started to find ways to learn Japanese online.
There were a bunch of apps, but with our internet connection being so fuzzy out here, none of them really worked.
She bought Japanese children's books, but those didn't help much with pronounciation.
She then realized that TAI was actually the perfect application to teach her all about Japanese.

So she got to work in creating an extension to it that would do a number of different things:
1. Automatically identify any object she circles with her hands and provide definitions in English and Japanese.
2. Allow the user to listen back to any conversation in Japanese or English.
3. Provide Japanese subtitles for any conversation in any other language.

It apparently could do a lot more, but that was the gist of it.
She had apparently been studying the best way to learn various languages and was confident that her app would be a huge success.
Her operating system is functionally the same as the old one except for the TAI extension.

There was just one problem.
Because it was an extention to TAI, and TAI was built into the operating system of most glasses, she needed to *completely wipe all the memory off her glasses before installing her new operating system.*
This meant that she would need two pairs of glasses, one to operate on, and another to guide her through the process.
So she did the obvious thing.
She snuck into my room, stole my glasses, and broke them.

Ok.
She shouldn't have done that last bit, but overall, I was impressed.
It was a neat project for a noble cause.
Even if she would have asked ahead-of-time, I would have given her permission, so she was doingt he courteous thing by trying not to disturb me while sleeping.
Well, I guess that was what she was thinking anyway.
There was no ill intent.
She just hadn't thought everything through.

Once she finished her explanation, I then asked the only real question I had, "And what about the red lights?"

"Oh, that was your idea." She said while brushing it off by waving her hand in the air.
She then tried to mimic me and said, "'No blue light after ten o' clock!' right? See, I listen every now and again."

What could I have said to that?
The "No blue light" rule was supposed to be a curfew on all technology past a certain time so she turn off her brain and sleep.
If she was already awake and fully engaged on a problem, then the rule was completely unnecessary and borderline harmful because it made it harder to see lab equipment.
It was yet another failed rule that was not worth enforcing.

So I stifled a yawn and told her, "Alright. I'm up. Let's fix this. Firstly, turn the lights on. Secondly, we're going to get a monitor to debug with."
I then hesitated a bit, trying to figure out how to phrase my next sentence.
During this time, Rei pursed her lips a bit and looked down, obviously ashamed of herself.
So I said, "Thirdly, new rule: no lab before five AM because that's the earliest I can wake up."
Translation: no late-night lab sessions without supervision.

She sighed a bit while processing what I had just said.
I'm not sure if she was relieved I wasn't angry or disappointed at the new restrictions.
Regardless, she eventually nodded, "Alright. Let's get the monitor," implicitly agreeing to the other restrictions.
She then picked up a remote and changed the lights back to their original color, causing both of us to wince.

While she was briefly tidying up the area to make sure nothing dangerous was left out, I took a moment to collect my thoughts and said, "To be honest, I like working at this time. No distractions. It'll be fun."
And then we were off.

To be honest, ever since the glasses were introduced on Nemo, monitors had more or less fallen out of fashion.
We kept a couple around, but only in deep storage.
And when I say "deep storage," I mean, "randomly littered throughout the island in weird nooks no one would think to look in."
The only one I knew about was in the observation bubble underneath the kelp processing facility.
I kept one there after an incident a few decades ago.
Wow.
It really was a few decades ago.
I'm old.

On our way over, Rei and I had a somewhat animated conversation.
Honestly, all of her conversations are animated.
I can't quite remember what it was all about.
Everything and nothing at the same time.
She was desinging some new goggles for Jake for his birthday.
She was anxiously awaiting the next shipment of parts to repair one of the solar ships.
There were a bunch of other projects she had in mind as well, all of which were interesting in their own way.

I found myself jumping from stone to stone, barely able to keep my balance amid the torrent of information she sent my way.
To be honest, she takes after you in tha regard, which is good because it means I have plenty of experience going with the flow.
Ultimately, I'm just a supporting character in her story.
In yours as well.
And Jake's
And everyone's really.
It's crazy how much support everyone needs when you live on the boundary of human knowledge.

I know I just made a fuss over how unkempt our own lab was, but it was nothing compared to the kelp facility.
Boxes were everywhere.
Some where open, others were not.
The desks were littered with all sorts of equipment: gloves, fins, pens, and anything else you could think of.
For some reason, none of the chairs were stowed and instead all jumbled together in the center of the room.

I knew exactly what I was looking for: a basement hatch along the far wall.
Unfortunately, it was completely covered by mounds of dusty boxes, none of which were properly tied down.
One good ocean swell would have caused all sorts of chaos.
Rei and I started joking around about how "no one on the island ever picks up after themselves" while heaving boxes around.
Eventually, we made a path and could open the doors to the observation deck.

One of my favorite parts about Nemo is that it is a literal floating island and filled with beauty in every direction.
The sky above.
The waves stretching towards the horizon.
The ocean beneath our feet, known to be some of the clearest water in the world.
Now that I think about it, it's mainly blue.

But when I opened up the basement doors and started walking down to the bubble under the island, I was hit with waves of nostalgia.
The creaking stairs.
The musty smell.
And most notably, the green hue of morning sunlight filtering through the algae on the outside of the bubble.

It wasn't a large space.
There was just enough room for a bench, desk, and a couple chairs, but it was enough to inspect the kelp farms to make sure they were growing.
Once the farm was big enough, no one really needed to observe it anymore and the bubble was left to collect dust and mold.
Like everything else on the island, it needed a good cleaning, but it felt like home.

I sat down and slowly started sorting through everything until I found a box labelled, "Lars's stuff."
Inside, there was an assortment of wires, a small tablet, and a portable monitor the size of my forearm.
After I pulled it out, I just sat there for a second, yawning and collecting myself while watching the kelp sway through the clouded glass.

Rei then sat next to me and said, "It's kinda cool down here, actually."

I nodded and said, "Yeah, I used to go here all the time to get away from Jake."

"And mom too?"

I laughed a that and nodded, "Yeah, mom too."
Sorry.

I guess I was still tired because I blinked again and we were back in lab.
The monitor was propped up on the table and completely filled with text.


The kelp lab was packed and dusty with AR boards litering the area.
Labcoats hung on chairs which were quite far from their resting positions.
If I hadn't known any better, I wouldn't have even known the observation deck existed as the entrance was hidden behind various pieces of lab equipment and notably a pile of boxes that all needed to be moved.

Rei and I took about half an hour reorganizing everything.
We didn't want to disrupt the researchers there, so we tried to leave most of the mess untouched.
Soon enough, the door was clear enough to open without fear of the pile of lab equipment trapping us in later.

I opened them to a dark staircase, and realized one thing: I truly love Nemo.
I was immediately hit with a nostalgic, musty smell that I had forgotten about long ago.
While we were reorganizing the lab, we had failed to realize that the sun had begun to rise around us.

One nice thing about being on a floating island is that nature is everywhere.
Left, right, up, and down.
And we were going down, under the ocean.
While walking down the stairs, I could see green caustics reflecting up from the bubble beneath.

The sun had begun to rise, so the 


I don't know if you remember the kelp plant very much.
It was one of those places you never seemed to go to.
But there were two parts to it: the noisy processing zone, and the lab area just next to it.
In the lab, you could still hear the machines whirring at pretty much any time of the day, but it was muted.


Under the bubble.
Sun rising and filtering through the green algae.
"Hey Dad." she said while I was rummaging for the monitor.
"Thanks."

She didn't have to specify.
I knew what she ment.
Still, it would have been nice for her to say it explicitly.

There aren't too many people able to contain her.
I guess years of you and Jake taught me enough to figure it all out.

A few blinks later and we had the glasses all wired up to the keyboard and monitor.
I impressed her by telling her to turn her glasses off so we could do everything old-school.
Eventually, we got everything up and running.

Around 8:00 Phil stopped by to pick up some old breadboards and Rei was sleeping while I was cleaning up.

The day went as planned.

Then the tour.

Eyes so dark, we looked like raccoons.

Japanese

"It worked!"

Anyway.
No lab before five in the morning.
That's the rule.

Which means I get up at 5 now.

Peace,
- Lars
