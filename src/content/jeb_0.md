# I'm Still Here

Hey Dad,

I'll sometimes turn everything off and sit at the dock.
No distractions, just me and my thoughts.

I read a study the other day saying that humans are happiest in nature[^1].
I feel like that's one of those things that are "obviously true" because in those moments, I feel truly at peace.
My heart slows down.
My breathing becomes deeper.
All the complications in my life start to unravel one by one.

My senses are all engaged with nothing.
I'll hear faint mumurs of distant conversations.
I'll taste the salt in the air.
I'll feel the water rushing against my legs.
Yet when I look out onto the ocean and watch the sun set, all I see is grey.

No matter how hard I try, my mind is always fixated on doing one, singular thing, and everything else feels like a distraction.
But when I finally have the time to do the thing, I don't.
I'll come up with so many excuses.
I'm tired.
It's too hard.
I'm not good enough.
So instead, I just sit at the dock, planning for events that will never happen.

I don't know.
There must be a word for this feeling.
Apathy?
Wistfulness?
Whatever.
I'm not smart enough to know what it is.

I just feel kinda broken.

Did I tell you Joanne left?
I mean, we are still together.

But she did it.
She's *doing* it.
The thing.
The thing she's wanted to do her entire life.

Meanwhile, I'm here.

At the dock.

Rei's about to be done with her evening lessons so I have to go make dinner.

We'll talk later.

Sorry,\
Lars
