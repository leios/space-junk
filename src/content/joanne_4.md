# The Olympics

Overview:

1. Lars reminisces about helping Jake build his Superlane.
2. He talks about the Olympics while watching swim lessons with Jake and Rei
3. Talk about how this was the turning point for Joanne in wanting to leave

Hey Joanne,

I've had my suspicions, but I think Jake might actually be a fish.
Or at the very least a mermaid.
Merman?

Like, you know that thing he does with his hands?
He'll clap them together, then pull them apart slightly under the surface of the water to fill them up.
After, he'll push them together to make a jet of water.

Literally hit me from the fucking dock.
What is that? 10 meters away?

We tried it.
Best we could do is 1 meter, tops.

Well, not Rei is doing it.
Except, she'll do it at home with the water from the sink.
It's like we have 2 Jakes now, except one of them is actually smart.

I mean, I'm a bit facetious.
Jake's smart.
Heck, he was the one that designed the artficial mangroves for the pool.

...

Sometimes I wish he had never left.

I mean, it was a big pivotal moment in his life.
He came back.

But you didn't.

I saw your eyes when watching him swim.
They were sparkling.

You couldn't wait to hear him

...


Anyway, I believe we need a biologist back to study whatever the heck this thing is.

Lars,

PS: Help.
