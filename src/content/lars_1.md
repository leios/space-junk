# The Bubble

Hey Dad,

Micheal and I were diving one day and came across a small hemisphere underneath the kelp processing facility.
It was hard to find because of, well, the kelp around it.

To be honest, we had never seen anything like it in Nemo, so we swam up to it and cupped our eyes to it to see inside.
Lo and behold [^What a phrase! I should use that more often!]!
We found you, scribbling alone on a tablet.
You were facing the other direction, so I don't think you knew we were there.

Micheal sent some texts to me through TAI, asking if we should knock or not, but before he did, I motioned for him to stop and hacked into your glasses to see your AR screens.
In that moment, I saw the entire inner surface of the bubble scribbled on with a mix of just about everything I could think of: equations, graphs, spreadsheets, and a bunch of written text.
There was also an entier map of the seafloor for the south pacific gyre, colored in red, green, and blue.
It was, frankly, the least organized dashboard I had ever seen.

At the time, I couldn't quite figure out what you were doing and decided to snoop a bit by peeking over your shoulder and on to your tablet.
I was surprised to see you writing a letter to Grampa Jeb.
I realized we were maybe peeking in on something we shouldn't have seen and texted Micheal to follow me as we kept swam away.
To this day, I don't know if you even knew we were there.

Sorry for spying.

Still, I spent years thinking about that moment.
Trying to figure out why you were there, alone, writing a letter to a person who certainly cannot write back.
What were the maps for?

Now that I'm older, I think I understand.
All I can say is "good luck."
With the insane oxygen levels in the pacific gyre, you might even find what you were looking for.

But more than that...
Sometimes, while on Nemo, it's impossible to communicate.
There are things to be said that cannot be due to logistical reasons.

Some words are simple and fun.
Others.
Well, others definitely shouldn't be bottled up.

So you retreat to your bubble and safely ... before they harm others.

Well, I found my bubble here.
