# The Bubble

Rei talks about their trip to the artificial mangroves

Hey Dad,

Remember that one day a while ago when I broke your glasses?

Well, it turns out I screwed up more than I thought.
While I was spamming through all the menus, I may (or may not) have been asked for the ID of the "owner of the account."
Seeing as how you don't have one, I put my own ID down.
This apparently gave me authority over your account and synced our data.

It's probably not a big deal, but it means that when you open an AR screen, I can see it and interact with it.
I might also have access to all of your data unless it's properly encrypted.
Speaking of which, why don't you encrypt anything?
I know "there are no locks on Nemo" or whatever, but you don't have *any* secrets?
None at all?

I recognize that I should have told you sooner, but the right time never came up.
So here I am writing a letter years later.

In our day-to-day life, this just means that when you open a screen, I can see it and interact with it.

Remember that one day when I broke your glasses.

Well, I messed up and accidentally synced our accounts.
Something about how yours wasn't authorized because you don't have an ID.

Anyway, that meant I had (and have) access to all of your screens.
I may have accidentally seen some of your files littered about.

And I might have read some of your writing.

Books are great.

Letters are...

Well, some were addressed to me, so I read them.

Sorry I didn't tell you before. I thought it was a line too far.

I know you said no boundaries, but this was a bit much.

Micheal and I were diving one day and came across a small hemisphere underneath the kelp processing facility.
It was hard to find because of, well, the kelp around it.

To be honest, we had never seen anything like it in Nemo, so we swam up to it and cupped our eyes to it to see inside.
Lo and behold [^What a phrase! I should use that more often!]!
We found you, scribbling alone on a tablet.
You were facing the other direction, so I don't think you knew we were there.

Micheal sent some texts to me through TAI, asking if we should knock or not, but before he did, I motioned for him to stop and hacked into your glasses to see your AR screens.
In that moment, I saw the entire inner surface of the bubble scribbled on with a mix of just about everything I could think of: equations, graphs, spreadsheets, and a bunch of written text.
There was also an entier map of the seafloor for the south pacific gyre, colored in red, green, and blue.
It was, frankly, the least organized dashboard I had ever seen.

At the time, I couldn't quite figure out what you were doing and decided to snoop a bit by peeking over your shoulder and on to your tablet.
I was surprised to see you writing a letter to Grampa Jeb.
I realized we were maybe peeking in on something we shouldn't have seen and texted Micheal to follow me as we kept swam away.
To this day, I don't know if you even knew we were there.

Sorry for spying.

Still, I spent years thinking about that moment.
Trying to figure out why you were there, alone, writing a letter to a person who certainly cannot write back.
What were the maps for?

Now that I'm older, I think I understand.
All I can say is "good luck."
With the insane oxygen levels in the pacific gyre, you might even find what you were looking for.

But more than that...
Sometimes, while on Nemo, it's impossible to communicate.
There are things to be said that cannot be due to logistical reasons.

Some words are simple and fun.
Others.
Well, others definitely shouldn't be bottled up.

So you retreat to your bubble and safely ... before they harm others.

Well, I found my bubble here.
