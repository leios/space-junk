# She's Just Like You

Hey Joanne,

I made a mistake.
Not one of those huge monumental mistakes that cause your entire life to spiral out of control.
A smaller one.
One so subtle that even in hindsight, I don't know what I could have done differently.

A few days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night.
I am not quite sure what the time was, maybe two or three in the morning?
It doesn't matter.
The point is that no matter how much I tossed and turned, I simply could not get back to sleep.
So I instead got up, slipped on my shoes, and started to walk while daydreaming at night.

I was truly exhausted.
It felt like my bones were moving while my muscles lagged behind, and I unconsciously swayed to and fro.
I hadn't felt that way since Rei used to wake up at a similar hour as a toddler.

Somehow, I found myself wandering along the same path.
The bench where she'd stash all her toys.
The communal kitchen where we'd make a midnight snack.
The dock where we'd dip our toes in the water.
Places where a baby could babble without waking anyone.

Now, hear me out.
We often think of the passage time as constant: minutes turn to hours, and then to days, years, and decades.
A second is always a second, no matter how we measure it.
But I really feel like there are nearly universal human experiences that contradict this notion.
The mornings after a hard night of work.
An afternoon spent deeply engrossed in a good book.
Late nights spent scrolling through the internet with an incredibly important deadline looming in the near future.

In these moments, time seems to change.
If you look at the clock and blink, hours could pass.
Or the opposite might be true: it could feel like hours between each tick of the clock.

That night, while sitting at the dock and splashing with my feet, I feel like I found another one of those time warping experiences.
I could not tell you what happened next.
I guess I had a few small dreams about us.
You, me, and Jake.

Sometimes, we'd be walking and talking near the dock and suddenly, without warning, I would hear a loud splash from the water and feel a dirty shirt fall over my head.
Jake would then call out, "Come on in! The water's great!"
Of course, he had been wearing his swimming suit underneath his clothes all day, because "jammers [^ A type of athletic swim suit] were just boxers with extra compression."
We, being the "normal" ones, would also be wearing normal, dry clothes.
Stuff that would be a pain to get wet.
So I'd always fold his shirt, take of my shoes, and sit at the dock while you fussed about whether you should jump in with him or not.
You never did.

We used to just sit there and chat for hours while Jake swam in circles.
Sometimes, we'd manage to herd Jake back on to land.
Sometimes, we'd be called by my dad for dinner.
Sometimes, we'd stay there till the satellites came out.
If we were lucky, even the stars.

That night.
While I sat there alone.
The sky was so bright.
I actually had to shield my eyes from the moon.

I felt like every time I blinked, I would find a new memory I had long forgotten.
The time we accidentally ruined half the samples in the ocean lab.
The time we gave a tour to dignitaries because Mark was too busy to talk to any of them.
The time it was just the two of us.
I was lying down.
You were sitting at the edge of the dock with your feet in the water.

Then.
Well, to be honest, I don't know if that last one was a memory or a dream.
I'm still wondering which is which, because when I opened my eyes, there was actually someone sitting beside me.
She was kicking a bit in the water while leaning back on her hands, staring off into space, and mumbling softly to herself.
The only problem was that it wasn't you.
It was Rei.

And it was, what? Almost four in the morning?

In that moment, I knew what I had to do.
I had to be a good, stern father and send her back to sleep.
After all, she's a growing teenager.
She needed -- needs rest.
I was planning on sitting up, grabbing her by the hand and saying, "C'mon, let's get back to bed."

But then her hands began waving in the air, and I realized she was using her glasses [^augmented reality glasses that project monitors into space for those wearing them] to reason about a problem.
So I silently laid there, pretending to sleep while eavesdropping on the conversation she was having with herself and trying to piece together what she was working on.

Now.
You know how I'm a deeply flawed individual who basically never gets anything right?
Well, one of my many flaws is that I can never quite find an appropriate emotional response.
I should have been frustrated.
Tired and annoyed at Rei for being up at an unreasonable hour.

But I wasn't upset at all.
I don't know what I was feeling, exactly.
Maybe it was pride for my daughter who took initiative to either stay up late or get up early to solve a complex problem.
Maybe it was happiness that she hadn't started her teenage rebellious phase and was still willing to hang out with an old man like me.
Without realizing it, a smile crept up on my face and I chuckled to myself.

And I think that was it.
My mistake.

Time froze.
The waves stopped.
She turned her head to me and said, "Good. I'm glad you're awake..."
And I blinked.

Suddenly, the lights were red.

To be honest, I initially thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I blinked again.
I then rubbed at my temples and stretched, trying to wake myself up.
No matter what I did, the lights remained red.

And the lab was a mess.
Screwdrivers were strewn about
Almost every drawer was open.
I don't know why, but there were three separate keyboards on the table, all missing certain keys.
Meanwhile, Rei was humming to herself while scrambling for something, somewhere.

And it was still four in the morning!

But you know how it goes.
I just couldn't.
In that moment, I couldn't be a good father.
She's just a force of nature.

Jake always says that he loves working out.
Not the working out part.
That sucks.
The part afterwards when your muscles are jelly, but before they become sore.
The part when you can't bend down anymore to pick up a pencil because you've already used up one-hundred percent of your energy.
The part where simple things become complicated and you need to relearn how to do everything.

In those moments, you can't help but laugh at your own helplessness.
And that's what I did.
I slumped down to the floor next to the door and laughed.

Soon, I heard a thump on the table and Rei said, "I need your help."

So I stood back up and saw she had a box filled with a bunch of different tools: a soldering iron, some sort of memory drive, wires of all different colors and sizes, and so on.
Next to the box was a completely dismantled pair of glasses.
*My* glasses.
The ones I needed the next day for work.

I wish I could have been angry.
I should have put my foot down and told her that this was not acceptable.
She should have come to me *before* damaging an important piece of equipment.
She should have known not to use someone else's property for some of her own experiments.
She should have at least waited until morning when more people were in lab in the case there was some sort of accident.

But she didn't.
And I couldn't.

But I *could* at least commit to the bit.
So I sighed and covered my face with my hand to hide my amusement and said, "alright. Explain yourself."

She didn't say anything immediately and instead inched herself closer to my face while tilting her head to look under my hand.
During this time, her hair pooled onto the table and I silently wondered if it would get caught in a wire.
After a few seconds, she said, "Promise you won't be angry?"

"I'm already furious." I said while chuckling a bit, "Now tell me what happened."

Ok.
Look.
Let's say you've got a rope and you decide to tie the two ends together to make a circle.
For the sake of the argument, we'll call this an unknotted circle, or an unknot.
Now let's say you stick that rope in your pocket and go for a run.
When you get back, the rope will probably be a jumbled mess, but if you carefully take your time, you can untangle everything back to the original circle.

That process of unknotting an unknot is precisely how it feels to decipher any conversation with Rei [^ It's also a fun math puzzle to look into if you are interested].
It's a bit of an agonizing process, but when it's all over, everything feels simple.
You'll go from, "What in the world is going on here" to "Ah, right. Simple enough." in a matter of seconds.
Or hours.
However long it takes.

Anyway, tangents on tangents aside, let me try to explain what was going on.

You know TAI? The *Translation* AI that comes preinstalled on all modern glasses?
Well, it does a lot of things.
It can answer just about any question by scouring the internet for you.
It can keep track of your vital information and let you know whether you need to sleep or eat.
It also translates anything anyone says around you into a language you can easily understand.

It goes without saying that TAI is absolutely essential when working in an international community like Nemo.
I mean, I don't even know what languages half the people are speaking in, but somehow we can all communicate just the same.
TAI does a pretty good job matching intonations and voice so it's sometimes hard to detect that the person is speaking a foreign language at all.
But "pretty good" is not "perfect."
It will sometimes fail to emphasize key words and phrases, and sometimes it's vocabulary is a little verbose and can cause some misunderstandings.
Certain jokes, for example, simply do not work after being translated.
Notably, TAI doesn't need to translate anything if the conversation is fully in a single language.

So here's the problem.
The other day, a new kid arrived on the island.
I think her name is Haruka?
She's a bit shy and hard to approach, but she's somehow still become a really close friend for Rei.
Haruka speaks Japanese exclusively and Rei speaks English, so the two of them are only speaking through TAI.

After a few too many miscommunications, Rei has been trying to find some way to learn Japanese online.
There were a bunch of apps, but with our internet connection being so fuzzy out here, none of them really worked.
She bought Japanese children's books, but those didn't help much with pronunciation.
She then realized that TAI was actually the perfect application to teach her all about Japanese.

So she got to work in creating an extension that would do a number of different things:
1. Automatically identify any object she circles with her hands and provide definitions in English and Japanese.
2. Allow the user to listen back to any conversation in Japanese or English.
3. Provide Japanese subtitles for any conversation in any other language.

It apparently could do a lot more because Japanese is apparently three languages in one or something, but that was the gist of it.
She is certain that her app is the absolute best way for her to learn Japanese and spent a relatively long time developing it with some special application she found online.

There was just one problem.
Because she intended to modify TAI, and TAI was built into the operating system of most glasses, she needed to *completely wipe all the memory off her glasses before installing her new operating system.*
This meant that she would need two pairs of glasses, one to operate on, and another to guide her through the process.
So she did the obvious thing.
She snuck into my room, stole my glasses, and broke them.

Ok.
She shouldn't have done that last bit, but overall, I was impressed.
It was a neat project for a noble cause.
Even if she would have asked ahead-of-time, I would have given her permission.
In a sense, this meant she was doing the courteous thing by trying not to disturb me while sleeping.
There was no ill intent.
She just hadn't thought everything through.

Once she finished her explanation, I then asked the only real question I had, "And what about the red lights?"

"Oh, that was your idea." She said while brushing it off (and physically waving her hand in the air).
She then tried to mimic me and said, "'No blue light after ten o' clock!' right? See, I listen every now and again."

What could I have said to that?
The "No blue light" rule was supposed to be a curfew on all technology past a certain time so she turn off her brain and sleep.
If she was already awake and fully engaged on a problem, then the rule was completely unnecessary and borderline harmful because it made it harder to see lab equipment.
It was yet another failed rule that was not worth enforcing.

So I stifled a yawn and told her, "Alright. I'm up. Let's fix this. Firstly, turn the lights on. Secondly, we're going to get a monitor to debug with."
I then hesitated a bit, trying to figure out how to phrase my next sentence.
During that time, there was a second or two of silence while Rei pursed her lips a bit and looked down.
She was obviously ashamed her experiment went awry in the first place and was starting to realizing the trouble she was putting me through.
Even so, she seemed to understand the situation well enough.
So I said, "Thirdly, new rule: no lab before five AM because that's the earliest I can wake up."
Translation: "No late-night lab sessions without supervision."

She sighed a bit while processing what I had just said.
I'm not sure if she was relieved I wasn't angry, disappointed at the new restrictions, or something else entirely.
Regardless, she eventually nodded and picked up a remote to change the lights back to their original color, causing both of us to wince.
She then said, "Alright. Let's get the monitor."
Translation: "See you tomorrow at five. For now, you're in charge."

I then helped her tidy up the lab just to make sure nothing dangerous was left out.
I then took a moment to collect my thoughts and said, "To be honest, I like working at this time. No distractions. It'll be fun."
And we were off.

To be honest, ever since the glasses were introduced on Nemo, monitors had more or less fallen out of fashion.
We kept a couple around, but only in deep storage.
And when I say "deep storage," I mean, "randomly littered throughout the island in weird nooks no one would think to look in."
The only one I knew about was in the observation bubble underneath the kelp processing facility.
I kept one there after an incident a few decades ago.
Wow.
It really was a few decades ago.
I'm old.

On our way over, Rei and I had a somewhat animated conversation, but I can't quite remember what it was all about.
Everything and nothing at the same time.
She was designing some new goggles for Jake for his birthday.
She was anxiously awaiting the next shipment of parts to repair one of the solar ships.
There were a bunch of other projects she had in mind as well, all of which were interesting in their own way.
I found myself jumping from stone to stone, barely able to keep my balance amid the torrent of information she sent my way.
To be honest, she takes after you in that regard, which is good because it means I have plenty of experience going with the flow.

The main thing is that she's a good person who is always trying her best to help others.
The way I see it, I'm just a supporting character in her story.
In yours as well.
And Jake's
And everyone's really.
It's crazy how much support everyone needs when you live on the boundary of human knowledge.

Now, I know I just made a fuss over how unkempt our own lab was, but it was nothing compared to the kelp facility.
Boxes were everywhere, many of which were open with their content strewn about the surrounding space.
The desks were littered with all sorts of equipment: gloves, fins, pens, and anything else you could think of.
For some reason, none of the chairs were stowed and instead all jumbled together in the center of the room.

And no.
I know what you are going to say, "Well, the whole island is essentially a giant boat, so it makes sense that the chairs move around at night."
That's obviously not the point.
They should have been properly locked up the night before.
This is one of the first things we tell newcomers: you *will* lose what you don't properly keep.

Fine.
Fine.
It was fine.
Whatever.
I knew exactly what I was looking for: a basement hatch along the far wall.
Unfortunately, it was completely covered by mounds of dusty boxes, none of which were properly tied down.
One good ocean swell would have caused all sorts of chaos.
I sighed and rubbed at my eyes again while failing to stifle a yawn.

The next thing I knew, I was halfway across the room and reorganizing a cupboard while Rei was heaving boxes around and joking about how "no one on the island ever picks up after themselves!" 

I barely even registered the comment and unconsciously responded, "No one but us anyway."
We kept chatting for a bit and eventually carved out our path to the doors to the observation deck.

Rei then tugged at the doors and clicked her tongue, saying, "It's locked."

I shook my head and sighed while also pulling at the handles. "No no. It's never locked. There weren't any locks in the early designs for Nemo. What we've got here is a good old fashioned jamming."

I don't know if you remember these doors or not, but they are at something like a forty-five degree angle and are made of a relatively thick metal.
So I positioned both my feet on the hinges and heaved as hard as I could.
No luck.
I tried a few more times, but the only thing that I manages to pull our was my back.

After realizing there was no hope, I stepped away for a second, trying to think of any other monitors that we could find without waking anyone up.
I also needed to take a break for a second, so I sat down while facing away from the doors and just began talking.
I don't remember what I said, but after a while, I noticed Rei stopped responding.
Suddenly, there was a loud, metallic thunk followed by loud cursing.

When I looked back, I saw Rei lying on the floor and rubbing her butt and head at the same time.
Her legs were wrapped in some sort of make-shift swing she had fastened to herself and also to the handle of the basement hatch.
She had also used one of the rafters as a bit of leverage and then just jumped with all of her might.

After the split-second it took me to analyze the situation, the two of us just burst out laughing.
There were so many better solutions.
But, as Rei tried to say through giggles, "It's not stupid if it works."

She was fine.
I mean, she complained about a sore tailbone for a bit.
But she's fine now.
At least physically.

Luckily the other door swung open without any issues, but when it did so, I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time.

See, Nemo is a strange place.
It's located at the single point on Earth that is farthest from any other living human, and there are so many different research projects going on in parallel that it's often hard to keep track.
I sometimes feel like I am just gasping for air while hopelessly trying to swim to a shore I know doesn't exist.
There's satellite retrieval, carbon sequestration, plastic recycling, and then daily needs like cooking, cleaning, helping Rei with whatever she's struggling with...
There's just so much to do.

Yet.
When the hatch was open, a familiar musty smell spread through the room, and I unconsciously took a deep breath.
It felt like my eyes were opened again for the first time in a long, long time.
I saw the sun slowly rising through a window in the kelp facility.
I saw green caustics cast along the inner walls to the staircase.
I saw my daughter -- our daughter -- nodding her head and motioning for me to go first down the stairwell.

I know these are just little things.
But somehow, it felt profound.
I've been so busy.
Working so hard.
And yet, there.
In that moment when Rei and I were working together to fix yet another problem.
I felt it.

The reason I could never leave.

To be honest, I am not sure if you had ever been there with me, but the staircase is relatively short.
Seventeen steps in a spiral that drills its way through the island and out the other side.
It's on the edge of the kelp garden where Nemo tapirs up to sea level, so there's a small landing for the staircase and then a large hemisphere that pokes into the ocean.
It was used for years to monitor the kelp growth, but after it was obvious the kelp was growing, well... people stopped using it and it became one of those strange nook in Nemo that no one even remembers.

But it's nice.
There is a desk and some cabinets for various pieces of equipment.
There's also this large metal grate that is used for flooring around the observation area.
When it's clean, it's absolutely beautiful.
There's just something mesmerizing about looking at the surface of the water from underneath, and watching the kelp sway back and forth with the sunlight filtering through...
I used to sit here for hours, completely lost in thought.

Even then.
Ok, it wasn't clean.
In fact, I could hardly see the ocean through the thick layer of algae on the bubble's surface.
Still, it was nice.
The morning light was just enough to cover the entire room in a green light, so I kept the lights off while rummaging.

I actually used to come down here so much that there was a special box labeled, "Lars's stuff."
Inside, there was an assortment of wires, a small writing tablet, and (most importantly)a portable monitor the size of my forearm.
After I pulled it out, I just sat there for a second, yawning and collecting myself while staring through the clouded glass.

Rei then sat next to me and said, "It's kinda cool down here, actually."

I nodded and said, "Yeah, I used to go here all the time to get away from Jake."

"And mom too?"

I laughed and nodded, "Yeah, mom too."
Sorry.

There was a pause for a moment before she leaned her head against my shoulder and said, 
"Hey Dad. Thanks."

I guess I was still tired because I blinked again and we were back in lab.
The monitor was propped up on the table and wired to my glasses. 
It was full of mono space text with a prompt at the bottom blinking and waiting for input.
Rei was fiddling with her own glasses and trying to find some good tutorials online, but I waved my hand in the air and said, "Don't worry. I know what to do."

In my heart, I had hoped saying this would impress her, but I think it actually just reinforces a recurring trend: I am old.
Regardless, a few blinks later, we had everything up and running.
About an hour later, Phil stopped by to pick up some old breadboards, while Rei was sleeping soundly on the table and I was cleaning up..

After recalibrating my glasses, I noticed we only had about half an hour until another group of new recruits arrived in Nemo.
As usual, I was the one on duty for welcoming them to the island and touring them around.
I sighed and stared up at the ceiling for a bit.
Now that my glasses were working, I didn't really have an excuse to skip.
I still silently debated whether to call in sick and let Jake do the tour, but he was probably training.
Besides, I was too tired to do any actual work and thought the tour would be a good way to get me through the mid-morning slump.
But.
Rei was coming with me.

I figured it was a fitting punishment, all things considered.
I also needed to start teaching other people on the island to do the tours because, frankly, I've been doing it for years at this point and no one else seems to want to do them anymore.

So I gently woke her up by rubbing her shoulder and said, "We've got a tour to do."

She then groaned, "No. *You've* got a tour to do."

"No. No. *We* are going to do it together this time. If TAI breaks on my glasses, you're going to have to step in."

She then rubbed at her face and tied up her hair without saying a word.
I took that as silent agreement from her part and began inching towards the door.
I yawned while opening the door, only to be shocked awake by the harsh sunlight.
I stood there for a second, trying to mentally psych myself up for the day ahead while Rei stumbled in behind me.
Her eyes -- our eyes, I suppose -- were so dark I wondered if the TAI would misidentify us as raccoons.
Before leaving, I stretched and decided to take a quote from Jake, "C'mon, 'Let's just do it and have a bad time.'"

We slowly made our way to the dock and by the time we got there, the new folks had already disembarked the ship and were standing idly standing about and chatting to one another.
"Alright." I quickly exhaled, as if preparing for a tough workout. "Rei, Let's go. Remember, if TAI breaks, you're up."

"Yeah, yeah." She nodded while rubbing her eyes again. "It won't break though, you reset your glasses to factory defaults, right?"

"I think so, but there's always a chance of something going wrong."
I've been wrong before.
I'll be wrong again.
That day, I had actually (somewhat accidentally) fully installed Rei's app.
I guess I just wasn't paying much attention considering how tired we both were.

I walked up to the group, and waved my had from afar, "Hello! I'm Lars and this is my daughter Rei! Sorry for being late, we are here to show you around!"
At this point, I was working off of pure muscle memory.
I had done so many of these tours that they were essentially second-nature.
So I then began shaking the hands of everyone there, one by one.
There were maybe fifteen or so in total?
I don't really remember the exact number.

What I do remember is that after quickly exchanging everyone's names, a middle-aged man with a strong black beard began saying something I couldn't understand.
TAI seemed to indicate he was Russian, and I could certainly hear Russian coming from his mouth.
Unfortunately, TAI refused to translate whatever this man was saying into English.
Instead, I distinctly heard Japanese.

I tried to cover my smile a bit as I looked to Rei.
She then looked back at me and blinked.
A second later, she began giggling a bit to herself before saying "I guess it worked?"

"Yup, which means..." I then addressed the group, "Before answering that question, my daughter has told me that she would like to lead the tour today."
I patted Rei on the back and stepped her forward while she gave me a look.
You know the one.
The one where she acknowledges that she's been outplayed.
"I really just came by to wish her good luck."

In my head, I thought to myself that I could head home for a quick nap and leave the tour to her, but she then stepped up and said, "Hello, I am Rei. This is actually my first time doing the tour, so my dad promised he would hang around in case I had any questions."
She lied.
Twice.
She had done the tour alone many times before.
I most certainly did not promise to "hang around in case [Rei] had any questions."
She just wanted me to suffer.


Whatever, we outplayed each other.
I gave her the same look back before nodding my head, "Right. I won't say anything unless you need help."

She also nodded and then addressed the man who asked the question, "Also, sorry for the delay. But to answer your question, 'Yes. We should be stopping by the bio energy lab, but I am not sure if Mack will be around. He might be off on one of the boats to check the status of the artificial mangrove area."

I guess the rest of the tour went about as expected.
We went from lab to lab, introducing everyone to everyone else.
As expected, Jake was nowhere to be seen.
Not sure where he had gotten off to, but it didn't matter.
While walking around, Rei kept making jokes at my expense and a few people tried to make small talk with me.
I obviously could not understand what they were saying because TAI kept translating into Japanese, so I just waved my hand and said, "We can talk later."

At the end of the tour, we led them to their rooms and told them to take the afternoon off before dinner.
We then exchanged really awkward goodbyes before Rei and I went home.
To be honest, I feel like all goodbyes are awkward with new folks.

On the way back, we both took off our performer masks.
We were so tired we had to sit down on a bench halfway.
And by "sit down," I mean "take a nap."
We were out.

We woke up at sunset, just watching the waves.
Chatting a bit.
Rei then said something interesting, "I didn't realize you were a celebrity."

I thought about pressing her to see what she meant, but I instead dropped it and said, "To be honest, neither did I."
We then went back to lab to tinker with our glasses a bit before dinner and bed.

No lab before five in the morning.
That's the rule.

Which means I get up at 5 now.

Peace,\
Lars
