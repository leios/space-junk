# You know that's impossible.

This chapter deals with Nemo's mission to Study whether it is possible to transform an oceanic desert into a livable environment for plants, fish, and (somewhat importantly) humans


> This is very, very difficult to do for a couple reasons.
> Nemo is located at the center of a large, slow moving, rotational current known as the South Pacific gyre.
> This means two things:
> 1. Because there is no current moving nutrients *in* to the gyre, it ends up being lifeless. No plants. No fish. Nothing.
> 2. Because there is no current moving *out* of the gyre, whatever ends up floating inside typically stays there and drifts towards the center.
> This is why there is a giant floating island of plastic in the middle of the north and south Pacific.
> 
> On the one hand, the south Pacific is known for having the bluest waters on Earth.
> On the other hand, it's an "Oceanic desert,"
> barren and lifeless outside of a few ancient bacteria in the ocean floor.
> The least habitable place on Earth.
> 
> A century ago, it would have been impossible to imagine living in such an environment, but with overpopulation and the climate crisis, people got desperate, so here we are.


# The stories

J: "No one's cute in a scuba suit."

L: "Ah, that's true, I guess?"

J:

L: What?

J: "You were supposed to say something like, 'you make it work.' or something."

L: Ah, right.

J: Well?

L: You make it work or something.

J: You're the worst!

L: I keep telling you that you can do better!

J: Well, Jake was busy training for the Olympics...

L: Ah, so what you're telling me is that you *can't* do better? Good to know.
