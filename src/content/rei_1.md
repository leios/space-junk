# The Superfin

1. Race against Jake w/ Superfin
2. rehash into a gyro to scan the ocean floor
3. Better fishing out old equipment by tethering to spider boats

Hey Rei,

We are running out of space on Nemo and need to do something with a lot of your old junk.
I mean, it's not junk.
But it's junk.

I've been collecting a lot of it in the Bubble because there's really no where else to put it.

I've actually repurposed the superfin into a gyro that scans the ocean floor.
