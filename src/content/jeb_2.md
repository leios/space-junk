# Sanity is not necessary

Jeb and Lars travel to see the stars
Jake, Joanne, and Lars get trapped near the mangroves?

Hey Dad,

I hate to say it, but the people living on Nemo are all crazy.
Every last one of them.
Myself included, I guess.
You too.
No.
Especially you.



This deals with: Track and collect all the satellites that land in the gyre [^3].


[^3]: Interesting fact: because nothing lives in the south Pacific gyre, it's not only the garbage bin for all of our Earthly human waste, but it's also where satellites are sent from space w
hen they are no longer useful because it's really unlikely to affect anyone or anything.
With the increase in space traffic, there should be an increase in the number of satellites coming down, and they all do that around Point Nemo and the surrounding area known as the Satellite
 Cemetary.

Jeb and Lars go out at night to watch the satellits blow up.

This effectively made you the world's first "space pirate."
Which was a fitting term, I guess.
I mean, you were certainly stealing expensive equipment from various countries, but is it actually stealing if they wanted to give it all up for free?
I would guess a more fitting term would be "space custodian," which is still a really cool job title, albeit not *as* cool as pirate.

No matter the case, Nemo is an island built from junk, and we actually managed to put most of the satellite material to good use.
And what we couldn't use, you made plans for how it could be used eventually.

He left all the docs unencrypted because "there are no locks on Nemo"

You used to run the satellite logistics branch on the island.
Any time a satellite had to come down, it would land somewhere in gyre.
You would then go, collect it and bring it back.
The problem is that by the time satellites die, they are functionally useless and filled with old tech that no one wants anymore.

You had the authority to force the nation who developed the satellite to take it back as a through _____.
This was a preliminary measure to make sure that space travel was safe *and clean* for everyone.

But you didn't do that.

You didn't even ask if the original countries wanted the tech back.
You just kept it.

I mean, in the years and years of giving countries the option to take it or leave it, almost every country left it.
So it's not like you were stealing anything worthwhile.
Also, we genuinely needed the tech and repurposed it in a bunch of ways for the island, so it wasn't all bad.

But I think that makes you the world's first space pirate.
Not a pirate in space, but someone stealing space equipment while on the Earth.

And that's how your lab, the "Jeb lab" came to be.
Just a mishmash of different satellite parts you couldn't find a use for.
But you tried.
You had a list of all the things you wanted to make stashed in a drawer if only a single part would come in from another satellite.

Now,
You've never even met Rei and you are still a bad influence on her!
When you left, you left all your documents in a drive in one of the cabinets.
Rei, the ever-impressionable young inventor, stumbled upon them and has now been spending all her time recreating the old ideas you had a long time ago.

So we built the drone.

Grabbed a spider boat to go get it.

Ended up going almost all the way to the mangroves.
