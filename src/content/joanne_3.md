# The Existence Party

Hey Joanne,

The moment Joanne got her passport, Lars began to recognize that she might leave.

We had another existence party for Rei the other day.

I am happy to say that after years of paperwork, Rei now has her passport as well and can leave whenever she chooses.
Hopefully not soon though.
I don't know what I would do if it was just me and Jake here.
Don't get me wrong, he's cool, but I am not ready to become an olympic athlete.

Regardless, today, I met the latest refugees.
Rei and I arrived a few minutes late, so they were all standing around awkwardly at the dock.
Realizing this, I jogged a bit forward and stretched out my hand to the person nearest to me, saying something like, "Hey, I'm Lars. Welcome to Nemo! Sorry about being late!"
The man did not react.
He was young, with a scruffy beard and short hair.
Possibly just finished his PhD.

He somehow missed me entirely and instead waved his hand towards Rei, saying, "Hello! We just arrived. TAI says there should be a tour. Are you the tour guide?"
He then furrowed his brows a little, "Ah, you are from the IRR? Are you a native here? That's incredible!"

Rei immediately responded, "Yeah, I'm from here. So is my dad."
She then nodded her head towards me and started giggling a bit.
See, during this time, my hand was still awkwardly extended.
I wasn't sure if I should pull it back or try to shake hands with another person.
So I just froze completely, which was apparently weird for an adult human to do.
Also the fact that she was recognized over me, her father, was somehow hilarious to her.

After this exchange, the tour continued as it always does and I got to know everyone rather well.
Later, when we returned home for dinner, Rei kept going on and on about how she was more important than me now that she got her passport, something even I was unable to do.

After I put Rei to bed, I realized something.
Now that she has her passport, I'm alone again.
The only person on Nemo who doesn't exist.

I guess I just miss being alone with you.

I know I could apply for a passport, but why would I?
To exist is to leave, and I never want to leave.

Still, I'm proud of who you've become and where you've gone.
I just miss you.
I miss us.
But we were only holding you back anyway.

See you soon,
- Lars
