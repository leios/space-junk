sometimes writing takes time for no apparent reason.

I've been sitting here, pen in hand for hours.
There's something I need to write, but I can't tell what it is.

# To Joanne
There's a fish outside the bubble right now.
Remember the whale?
Who am I kidding, of course you do!
You talked about it for years and years!

"Proof that oligotrophic waters can support life!"

"With human intervention" I would always say.

"Exactly! We can fix this."

And now you're gone. Just me and Jake left.

# Joanne 2

J: "No one's cure in a scuba suit."

L: "Ah, that's true, I guess?"

J:

L: What?

J: "You were supposed to say something like, 'you make it work.' or something."

L: Ah, right.

J: Well?

L: You make it work or something.

J: You're the worst!

L: I keep telling you that you can do better!

# Dress Days
"What if I was a girl?"

"What if you were? I don't think it would matter too much to me. I would need another gym partner though..."

"Nah, even as a girl, I'd gym with you."

"Fuck dress days, amiright?"

"Yeah, fuck dress days."

# The implant
One of the new recruits had an implant.
I like my glasses though.

# The natives vs new recruits
I always felt a bit guilty about being a native.
Everyone else had to go through intensive vetting procedures and be hand-picked by a comittee, while I got here for free.

# Jake's swimming problem
We'd be walking, just the two of us, and Jake would start stripping his clothes, down to his underwear, which were of course swim Jammers.
He's then give me his clothes and jump in the water.

"Why walk when you can swim?"

Then he's not only be late for class, but also dripping wet.

He actually tinkered with his goggles so he could take class while swimming.

I'm just glad he couldn't get a sunburn.

# The last letter to Jeb
Hey Dad,

I found you.
See you soon.
- Lars.

# From Rei

Hey Dad,

- I found your letters.

- I met Mom

- You would hate it here (haha)

- I want to introduce you to Kim

- I found my own bubble here on the ISS.

# From Lars

Hey Joanne,

- Remember when we met Jake?

- There was a whale. I repeat: A real, living whale!

- I baked a cake for Rei. An Existence cake.

- Did you hear?

- "No F***ing way!" That's what you said after the call. It was nice to see you again. Really. (She visits for another few years before being off again. Comes after she hears there's fish)

Hey Dad,

- I found you

- Remember when I broke my glasses?

- I'll sometimes sit at the dock

- Sometimes you can't tell the difference between satellites and stars

- Have you met Rei?

- A final farewell.
  Jeb spends his adventure looking for things to allow Jeb's body to decompose:
  - A coffin with algea
  - superfin
  - Drone inspired him to make one of his own to look on the ocean floor.

Hey Rei,

- Remember the superfin?

- You are here now, but you won't be forever. I'm writing this to get my thoughts together.

- I'm so proud

- The infinity pool

- Hey. It's going to be ok. I promise. It will be ok. (It's my turn to leave. Jake promised to send me off.)

# The budget
People brnig up lars. Joanne and Rei defend him as "the single person keeping Nemo together"

# I cannot leave
Lars is actually denied paperwork

# My Dad

I made a mistake.
One that will haunt me for the rest of my life.

I tried.
Dad.
I tried so hard.

It's just that when I was there, with everyone looking at me.
I couldn't.
There was Jake, President Collins, ...
Mom.

I couldn't do it.
So, dad.
Here's my speech.
The one I couldn't deliver.

I'll use the superfin to send it to you.

I can say without a doubt that my dad is the single greatest thing to ever come from this god forsaken place.
No
No
No
Just a bunch of smart people with a dream.

My dad, though, he made it happen.
He knew every experiment in and out and helped with every single one.
He 
He was there for me every single night, testing and debugging random things.

I saw how hard he worked.
The lab was spotless.
We paid it forward.
He, alone, kept this island running.

And now he's gone.
So am I.
And my mom.

I feel like Nemo lost more than another researcher when Dad left.
It lost it's very soul.

# Lars from Jake's perspective

He always said he wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but he was close.
Way sharper than I am anyway.
He keeps this place afloat.

# Joanne and Lars

We are good together, but better apart

# Jeb quotes

Only fools fail to listen to their emotions. We have them for a reason.
You don't always need to follow your heart, but you should at least listen to it.
