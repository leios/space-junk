Hey Dad.

Tai keeps telling me to talk to an actual professional about all this -- specifically because it knows about you.
It thinks there's something criminal going on, and it won't talk to me without my full cooperation on what it thinks is a criminal investigation.
The problem is that there's another kessler brown-out right now and our internet is on the fritz. I couldn't send the information upstream even if I wanted to.
No matter how good AI gets, it's always just a little too smart for it's own good.

Anyway, I am going to keep writing these letters for a bit.
They are helping me a bit I think.
More than Tai anyway.
