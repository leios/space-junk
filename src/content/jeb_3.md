# Not with you

Hey Dad,

There's something I need to tell you.
A secret, I guess.
Something I know but know I shouldn't.

There was a time ... Spider boat at night / Kessler Syndrome.

Space laser...


"Why don't you leave?"

"I can't. Not with you here."

Sometimes there are words that remain stuck in your psyche for the rest of your life.
Sometimes it's ...
Sometimes it's an innocent phrase.

I understand now what you meant, but I didn't know it at the time.
You couldn't leave, but felt embarrassed as to why, so you covered it up by trying to say "I love you too much."
But I interpreted it wrong.

Initially, Nemo was just criminals who had no home. That was why it was so difficult for Joanne and Lars to get their documents sorted.

The court case Lars accidentally saw.

Jake hacked in.

"Sorry Lars. This is a conversation for adults."

"We are almost adults."

"Almost, but not quite..."
