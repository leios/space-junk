# Where Else Would You Be?

Hey Dad,

The other day, I (somewhat accidentally) introduced Rei to the Bubble while we were on an early morning adventure.
At this point, I think we are the only two people on the island that know it even exists.
It's an essentially untouched time capsule, complete with a collection of all my old stories.
I don't think she'll have any reason to go back.
I don't have any reason to either.

Yet I'm here in the Bubble right now, writing something no one will ever read.
Just like I always have.
For the past few hours, I've been ignoring all my work and sifting through my old drives.
I can't explain why I came back.
Maybe there doesn't need to be a reason.
Too much logic ruins a good story.

Did you know I had written a book about a civilization without the concept of language?
It was so hard to write in English.
You know, a *language*.

I also did a word count on that crazy series I tried to write.
Over one million words.
I had written and rewritten the first few chapters so many times that the book seemed to be written by two completely different authors.

I have read through so many letters.
To you.
Joanne.
Myself.

I don't know how to express the emotions I am feeling right now, but I guess I should try.
Why else am I even writing this?

Children dream childish dreams.
They pick up sticks and pretend they are swords while role-playing as heroes who never existed.
Every stone is prop in their own story.
But as they grow older, they stash all their sticks and stones in a box and leave them to rot somewhere, never to be seen again.

!!! Note: switch to second person here is intentional, but maybe not worth it?

Soon, every day turns into a constant stream of nearly unsolvable problems.
A boat's leaking.
Some researchers are squabbling.
Fred still can't figure out how to connect to the intranet after the fifteenth time you have personally explained everything to him, and IT is too busy to help him, so you need to spend another hour with him to solve an issue specific to his unique configuration of his glasses.
Don't get me wrong, Fred's great.
It just feels like no one has the time or patience to let you breathe.

Eventually, your head is down.
All you can think of is the ever-increasing list of boxes to check off.
You can't remember the last time you even looked someone in the eye, let alone took an afternoon off.

And then you find that collection of sticks.
Suddenly it's the only thing you can think about.

!!! Note: again switch to first person is intentional

It's not like life was easier as a child.
There were always things to do, especially on Nemo.
But there was a time when I could think.
There was a time when I could write.
There was a time I was the main character in my own story.

I had so much hope when I was younger.
I guess that was one of the many childish things I threw away.

I feel like here, in this old moldy bubble, I can finally breath.
Actually, looking at it, there's a lot of mold.
So much, in fact, that I am probably going to get sick just by being here.
Nevertheless, I tried polishing the glass a bit to see through the algae and watch the kelp a moment.
All I saw was the reflection of an old man.
Raccoon eyes.
Unkempt facial hair.
Glasses that don't quite fit on my face.
And a small box in the corner of the room with my fins and a squeegee.

I'll continue this later.
I have some cleaning to do.

...

I don't know how long it's been.
Maybe a few weeks?
It doesn't matter.
A lot happened in the meantime.
I guess I'll start at the start.

Immediately after I put up my pen and writing tablet, I got to cleaning.
Well, I tried to anyway.

The Bubble's essentially at sea level, so when I was younger, I would just put on some jammers and fins and dip beneath the surface to clean the outside. 
It took about half an hour and I used to do it once or twice a month.
This time, it didn't take thirty minutes. 
It took a week.
In fact, it took almost a full day for me to find my jammers.
And then another day to put them on.

As I made my way from the kelp facility to our house, I was followed by a swarm of people all needing my help with specific problems.
I think that was when the solar panels were starting to go offline?
Or maybe it was NORAD [^1] detecting another internet brownout?
There was something big happening.
I know it was recent, but I really don't remember the specific details.
Nemo's not exactly known to solve small problems, and big problems appear small when you have too many of them.

[^1]: The North American Aerospace Defense Command. These guys do a lot of different things, including tracking all the junk in space.

By the time I got home, the sun was down and Rei was sleeping soundly.
I guess it was around ten o' clock?
I didn't have the heart to wake her up while rummaging for a swim suit I couldn't even use until the next day, so I also crawled in bed and tried to sleep.
Besides, due to circumstances outside of my control, we both get up at five in the morning now, so it was time for bed.

Before going out the next day, I found the jammers and tried them on.
I guess I should have counted myself lucky that they still somehow fit.
Unfortunately, I didn't have much more time before being called to lab, so I took them off again and rushed to work.
Again, I have no idea what I did that day.
Something so important that I forgot, I guess.
But I didn't have a free moment to clean the Bubble.

The next day, I took a page out of Jake's book and kept the jammers on under my normal clothes.
He still swears by them being the best underwear for any occasion.
I mean, they are essentially boxers, just tighter.
Water resistant compression shorts.
The difference is that he doesn't have as much to compress.

No matter the case, on that day I was determined to clean the Bubble.
I got through everything as quickly as possible, trying to find the opportunity to rush over to the kelp facility and get to work.
At around three o' clock, I had finished up some maintenance on one of the boats and sat there for a quick breather while dangling my feet off the dock.
I realized in that moment that it was time.

I stood up and jogged towards the Bubble.
While on my way, I heard a series of footsteps approaching me quickly from behind.
Even without turning, I already knew exactly who it was.
The only person to walk around a research lab without shoes on.

I couldn't outrun an Olympian.
So I sighed, slowed down, and cursed a bit under my breath before turning around and saying, "Hey Jake. What's up?"

He replied, "Yo, Lars. Long time no see. How've you been?"

I know you haven't seen Jake in a while, but his fashion sense has only gotten worse.
On this occasion, he was wearing a "lab coat" that was actually just a bathrobe he wore around lab.
It was completely open in the front, showcasing his abs and bright blue jammers.
As I said before, no shoes.
Goggles as a necklace.
Swim cap tucked away in one of his pockets.
This guy.

Don't get me wrong. Jake's great.
There is no other person on the planet that I am closer to.
But in that moment, I really just wanted to clean, so I tried to shake him off.
"Yeah, I'm doing alright. I was just off to..."

He cut me off, "The pool's actually been moved. It's over that way."

"Wait." I paused for a second. "Why do you think I am going to the pool?"

He smiled and nodded while eyeing the edge of my shorts, where my own pair of jammers peaked out a bit.
He then said, "I never thought the Jam Bros would be back in action. You always say you're too busy!"

I realized then that I had actually been flaking on him at every opportunity for a long time.
Maybe years.
We barely spoke anymore.
Overcome with guilt, I faked a smile back and said, "Well, you caught me. Where's the pool now?"

So we walked, talked, and generally had a good time.
He was so happy to see me swimming again that he didn't even mind that it took me about a minute thirty to finish a hundred meters.
We had our own lanes anyway.
But man is he fast.
I knew it.
But man is he fast.
His front crawl was faster than my sidestroke.
After the workout, I hobbled myself out of the water and Jake threw a towel over my shoulders.
He then said, "Hey. I know you are busy, but I miss hanging out."

I nodded and replied simply, "Yeah. Let's do this again sometime."
I don't think I *quite* realized what I was agreeing to at the time because the next day I could not move.
I had to call in sick for our morning lab activities with Rei.
In fact, I couldn't do almost anything at all, meaning I had double the work the next day.

But the day after that, I had the afternoon free and managed to sneak my way into the kelp facility.
The kelpfolk were missing, as always.
In fact, I don't even know who works there anymore.
Throughout my life living on this island, I don't think I've ever actually seen someone working there.
Yet, the room is always a mess.
Do they only work at night?
I don't know.
It also doesn't matter.
I was five days late to cleaning, but who (else) was counting?
I grabbed my fins and rushed to a small landing with a ladder to enter and exit the water.

I then took off my glasses and stood there watching the kelp float on the surface.
I don't know why, but the few moments before jumping in the water always feel like an eternity.
My brain just shorts out for some reason.
I stifled a yawned and stretched, trying to muster up the courage to jump in.

I then did the most beautiful dive an old man like me could have done and immediately got to work.
And by "got to work," I mean that I failed miserably at cleaning.
It might have been that there was more algae than ever before, or maybe it was because I am old.
No matter the case, I found myself gasping for air and needing to take regular breaks.
However, I was fresh off my training with Jake and stubbornly refused to grab my respirator and oxygen tank.

As I was cleaning, I tried to cup my hands against the glass to get an idea of how much work was left to do on the inside as well, but it was hard to see due to the difference in lighting.
When I moved away, I saw a glimpse of myself.
I knew I was old.
Just the other day, I saw an old man in the mirror.
But in that moment, all I saw was a giddy little kid in goggles, excited to get back to writing in his own little world.

A few hours later, I was done.
My heart was beating and my mind was racing with new story ideas.
I flopped out of the water and didn't move until the moon was out.

While there, I had some time to think and realized this was the first time in years I had done something for me.
Not for Rei.
Not for Jake.
Not for some random person on Nemo.
Me.
The Bubble is mine.

I could have left it.
I should have left it.
But I didn't.
Somehow it felt good to polish off my box of sticks.

The next day, I also managed to wriggle free some time to clean up the interior as well.
It took all afternoon, but I got it done.
Then I just sat there, reading old stories until I had to meet Rei in lab the next morning.

Throughout the next week, I tried to return to the bubble whenever I could and even began a small challenge where to write a short story a day for a full year.
I don't know if I'll complete the challenge or not, but I'm happy to have some personal goals again.
Eventually, I got back to writing this letter.

To be honest, I'm not really sure what to say.
Or even why I am writing this to begin with.

A long time ago, you told me that "There are no locks on Nemo, but some doors are hard to find."
I took that as a challenge to find a place no one else knew about.
Somewhere I could be truly alone.

So while Jake was training and Joanne was studying, I scoured through every nook on the island.
I found quite a few good ones.
Some were close to home.
Others took some shimmying to get into.
But the Bubble.
This place was immediately special.

There is plenty of room to move around, a free cabinet and table, and a calming underwater ocean view.
During the day, the light scatters in just the right way to illuminate everything with mesmerizing green caustics.
At night, it's too dark to see into the ocean and it feels like I am floating in the middle of some endless void.
On top of that, the kelp processing is automated, so there are rarely any people in the lab to see me running in and out.
Simply put: it was the perfect place for a teenager to do whatever embarrassing, secretive activity they could want.
But I was a boring teenager who didn't have any secrets to hide.

For a while, I would stop by periodically when I needed a moment of focus.
Soon, those moments turned into hours.
I think that might have been the first time I really thought.
No glasses.
No distractions.
Just me, the ocean, and my imagination.
I eventually began jotting everything down.
The more writing I did, the more writing I wanted to do.

It wasn't like I intentionally hid this part of my life from Jake or Joanne.
I was mainly just happy to have a dream as well.
Jake would be an Olympian.
Joanne, a biologist.
Me, an author.

The problem was that my writing was (and still is) relatively poor.
When I read some of my favorite books there's poetry to the prose.
The words feel like a song.
My words were a cacophony of mixed messages, never really forming a cohesive narrative or structure.

And that's ok.
The first step of every journey is always a little unsteady.
I needed to train, just like Jake.
To study, like Joanne.
To hope that eventually I could find myself.

Days turned to weeks, and then months and years.
I would write novels.
And then rewrite them.
And rewrite again and again until I was tired of the story and moved on to the next.
And then the next.

Thousands of unread pages, all stashed away in the Bubble.
Secrets hidden in one of the many lost doors of Nemo.

To this day, I don't know why I had such a need for secrecy, but it was nice having a place to myself.
It was a world that only *I* knew existed.
Well, you found it eventually.

A long time ago, I had a free day.
No classes.
Jake and Joanne were preoccupied.
It was a perfect Bubble day.
So I snuck to the kelp facility and into the Bubble.
On the way, I noted particularly cloudy skies and remembered a warning from you about how the weather forecasted a strong Typhoon over the weekend.
That meant there wouldn't have been any problems so long as I got home before sundown.

There was still plenty of time to do my thing.
I don't remember exactly what I was thinking at the time, but it was probably something like this:

"I wonder why the light is refracting that way today."

*Don't forget to get home by sundown.*

"Right, I should finish up the story about the girl who could animate her dolls by giving them her life force."

*Get home by sundown.*

"I read more papers. I like papers."

*Get home."

"I haven't written any poetry recently."

Suddenly, the sun was down, the lamp was on,  and violent ocean swells were rocking the entire island while kelp was violently thrashing against the window.
It was, without a doubt, the most dangerous situation I had been in in my life.
There was no way I could travel safely from the kelp facility back home.
Then came a series of horrible coincidences.

I soon heard a loud *thunk* against the doors to the Bubble.
I immediately ran up the stairs and pushed against them as much as I could.
No matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't budge.
The best I could figure was that the swells had caused some nearby junk to topple over and block my only exit.

So I cursed a bit while walking back down and collected my thoughts near the lamp light.
Logically, there was no cause for concern.
Nemo had seen it's fair share of Typhoons.
This one was no different.
The Bubble would survive.
I would survive.
I would just be in for a rough night of sleeping, that was all.

In that moment, I turned notifications back on on my glasses and noticed a barrage of messages, not only from you, but also from Jake and Joanne.
No one knew where I was, but before I could send a message back to let everyone know I was fine, the power went out.

I would like to say I was brave in that moment, but I was not.
I panicked and curled up into the fetal position in the middle of the room.
I also suddenly realized that if the electricity was off, so was the ventilator.
That meant there was a possibility that I could run out of oxygen, so I began doing breathing exercises to get my heart rate down.
I scrapped that plan the moment I realized I had no way to accurately measure my heart rate.
My entire life flashed before my eyes, and I began to worry about what my friends and family would think when they found me weeks later, *if* they found me at all.
To be honest, I don't know if I fully understand what I did next, but I am sure in that moment, it made perfect sense.
I began to clean the room.

I can only imagine I thought to myself, "Well, if people are going to find me dead, at least they won't think I'm a slob when they do."
So I scrounged around the room in total darkness until I found the cleaning solution.
I mopped the floors, scrubbed the walls, organized the tools.
I did everything I could think of, all in total darkness.

In fact, I had gotten so into it, I had failed to hear a loud scraping against the cellar door.
In a few moments, it causing me to shield my eyes to a flashlight.
I then saw you standing there, huffing and puffing and surrounded by boxes.

I couldn't quite see the expression on your face, but I imagine it was right in the center of blind rage and thorough relief.
You then chuckled a bit while kicking another box out of the way and said, "I didn't realize you were redecorating. Please carry on."

As I looked around, I realized my mistake.
Apparently in my panic, I had mixed up the cleaning solution with orange paint.
To this day, I still I don't really even know how I did that, but the entire Bubble had become an abstract orange painting.

No matter the case, I rushed up the stairs, only for you to hold your hand out and stop me before entering the kelp lab.
"Leave the paint. And maybe your clothes."
You then started fumbling under one of the desks with your flashlight.
While I was stripping, the backup generators started and you said, "Alright. Come up. Let's talk."

"Wait. Wait." I called back while awkwardly laughing. "Let me at least put on my jammers. It's embarrassing to be only in my underwear."

You then responded, "How is it less embarrassing to be in jammers? They are literally *more* revealing."

While still fumbling in the dark, I said, "Don't ask me. That's a question for society at large."
A minute later, I was up in the lab with adequate lighting and realized that you were *soaked*.
I could only imagine you had been searching the entire island in blistering winds and rain to find me.
With the ocean as crazy as it was, it was entirely possible to be thrown overboard to never be seen again.

I usually tried to be cool, calm, and collected, but what you had just done was the bravest thing any person had ever done for me, and while processing that, I hugged you and cried.
After a moment of wiping tears from my face, I said, "See. It's good I have my suit on. You're soaked. I dressed for the occasion."

You then lifted down your pants a little to show that you were also wearing a suit. "I dressed up too."
We both laughed before you began asking questions, "Alright Lars. I need to know. What are you doing here? Why didn't you answer any of my messages? We've been searching for hours and I had to send Jake and Joanne home because it was too dangerous."

I sighed a bit before answering honestly,"I've been coming here in secret for a while."

"To do what?"

Again I hesitated, but given the situation, I answered simply, "Writing."

You then gave me a somewhat confused look while processing what I had just said.
Under what situation would someone be hiding something so tame?
You then said the following, "Alright. Here's what we are going to do:

1. We are going to clean up that mess you made in the store room down there. Orange. Really, what were you thinking? It really clashes with the rest of the room.
2. You need to send me a message when the sun goes down every single day. I need to know you are ok. I know Nemo's mostly safe, but *mostly* safe is not safe enough.
3. It looks like we've got plenty of time until the winds die down. We need something to pass the time. I'd love to read some of your work, if you would let me."

I actually had a very similar conversation with Rei recently.
I have always felt like you were more than a father to me.
You were a friend.
A confidant.
Someone I could rely on through everything.
It was moments like these that really proved that.

A few hours later, while still scrubbing away, I asked you another question.
One that I still don't understand even in hindsight.
"Hey Dad. How did you even find me?"

"Well, after exhausting every logical option I started thinking about the illogical ones."
You paused for a second and then said, "To be honest, of all the places on Nemo, where else would you be?"

Throughout the night I began talking to you about all the different stories I had written and why I thought they were interesting.
You began engaging back, which is the most important thing in the world for kids as they grow up.
For the next few years, you were the only person in my life I had opened up to about my secret, and for a while I was happy to have a friend.

But you are gone now.
And I'm back in my bubble.

Anyway, I hope you are well.\
Lars
