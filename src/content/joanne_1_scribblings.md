# It's better here.

Hey Joanne,

# Lars wakes up and wanders aimlessly towards the dock, only to find Rei.
# that burst of energy in the middle of the night.
# Sell the fogginess of memories and how we all remember things differently.
# Lars and Rei stay up at night now.
# Explain what TAI is and sell it as *the only way to possibly communicate with the majority of people on Nemo*
# Talk about the tours and how TAI spoke Japanese

I made a mistake.
Not one of those huge monumental mistakes that cause your entire life to spiral out of control.
A smaller one.
One so subtle that even in hindsight, I am unsure as to whether it's a mistake at all.

About a month ago, I woke up in the middle of the night.
It must have been maybe two or three in the morning.
I tossed and turned, but could not get back to sleep.
So I instead got up, slipped on my shoes and started walking aimlessly through the night.
Just like we used to do when Rei woke up at night as a toddler.

I found myself wandering along the same path.
The bench.
The lab.
The bubble.
Places where a baby could babble without waking anyone up.
All familiar scenes, now foreign in the darkness.

It's an odd feeling, daydreaming at night.
My body felt sluggish, like my bones were moving while my muscles lagged behind.
Without knowing how or why, I would just appear randomly at one location and then another.
I swore I could hear Rei's first words "What *is* that?"
At some point, I felt the rush of water on my skin while throwing her in the air for swim lessons.
I panicked when I thought I left her tricycle behind somewhere, knowing she would throw a fit when she remembered it was missing.

I know the memories were just stories made up by my own delusional mind and only loosely based in reality.
Still, I found myself chuckling.
I miss the old days.
When life was simple.

At some point, I swear I began dreaming full-on.
It looked like the lights to dad's workshop was on, so I entered.
And tehre was Rei, up and about...

At some point, I found myself at the dock.
Without thinking, I took my shoes off and dipped my feet in the water and just stared at the stars, trying to remember any of the constellations dad used to point out for me.
# CHECK TO MAKE SURE THESE ARE VISIBLE IN THE SOUTHERN GYRE
Orion.
The Southern Cross
Alpha and Beta Centauri?
He always said it was good to know in the case of a satellite blackout, but to be honest, I don't think it would be possible to find Nemo by boat without GPS.
I mean, it's literally floating in the middle of the Ocean.
It's position changes depending on the currents.

I remember thinking that the night was awfully calm, all things considered.
We could hear Nemo creaking a bit with the waves, but otherwise nothing.
I guess because of this, I became acutely aware of the water rustling right next to me, followed by a soft pressure of someone's head on my shoulder.

Rei was up.
At this unholy hour.
Just like old times.

And just like old times, I found myself to be the father of a toddler who goes whever she pleases whenever she wants.
It's just that she's not a toddler now.
She's a teen.

A teen who still trusts me just as much as she always did.
So I don't know if that makes me a good father or a bad one, but as long as she's happy, I guess I am too.
She's apparently acing all of her classes and really motivated to learn everything thrown her way.
Who am I to stifle her creativity?

Even if her creative energy peaks at midnight.

And that's how we ended up in the workshop at 4:00 AM debugging her new app.

I gotta be honest, I have no idea what was going on.
She said she wanted "TAI to switch languages with a toggle, but didn't want to use her own glasses because they could break."
And when we got there, I saw my own glasses disected and on her workbench with some form of soldering iron all ready to go.

"To be honest, I was about to wake you up anyway. Don't worry, I took the memory module out, so it's just a matter of flashing the BIOS with a new OS."

Fuck.


I couldn't help but smiling a bit, but buried my head in my hands and signed somewhat loudly.
"Do you have any idea what time it is?"

She just pushed her head harder against my shoulder and said, "No. I left my glasses at home. I would guess something like 3 or 4?"

I couldn't help but laugh a bit.
She was awake awake.
No way she was getting back to sleep.
Just like old times.
But I tried to be a good father, "Look. Your mom would kill me if she knew you were up at this hour. You need your sleep. You're young."

She moved off of me, now resting her hands around her waist while splashing in the water. 
She then said, "Yeah, but you're old. I can just nap during the day. You've got work or whatever to do."

I silently wondered how she ended up so like you, but put my foot down.
"And you have school. You need to sleep."

"Right, 'School'", she over-emphasized the word. "Both of us know it's not actual school. It's just me and TAI. Micheal just happens to be in the same room. I mean, why not just take the classes when I want? Jake said he always attended classes while swimming."


Being a parent sucks.
But sometimes, when you are lost in thought, it takes one good memory to lead you back home.

While walking, I found myself at the dock....



No matter the time, there is almost always someone awake at night, toiling away in their lab.
But that night, there was not a soul in sight.
It didn't really matter.
I was daydreaming at night and my memories kept me company.

You once told me that cuteness must be evolutionarily advantageous.
After all, Rei was just about the cutest possible thing that could ever exist.
And there's no way you could even think about hurting something that cute.
Well, I'm keen to believe you now.
Because, that night, while meandering about, I found myself humming the same songs we used to to get her to sleep.
I would laugh thinking about the time she...

I know they are memories.
Stories that our brains have warped into bittersweet ___ that...
Yet, in my groggy state, I found them comforting.

Still, I know these moments will pass.
What I remember as sleepless nights, she'll remember as some of the best nights of her life.
All because I took the time to be with her.


Seeing as how she's so young and someone has to take care of her, I've beens truggling to do my normal work, so I've been doing odd jobs.
1.
2.
And, of course tours. Granted, they only come by every few months. Still, it takes time to settle the new recruits in to Nemo.

Rei's been joining me for the tours recently.
She's still a little too young to answer any questions directly, but she's great moral support, at least.
Plus, it's harder to look past two people than one especially when one is toddling around.


When your heart's so far from home.
It's hard to be both here and there.

# Image of Nemo with flowchart and notes
1. Start at the dock.
2. Be sure to introduce yourself so TAI can understand and translate.
3. Plastic repurposing lab first.
4. Then the observation deck / buoyancy well.
5. Explain how Nemo floats.
6. Go to the farms and explain the rice, fish, fruit, and veggies.
7. Then go to the Eutrophication Lab and talk kelp.
8. Really, talk kelp.
9. Keep Joanne from rambling too long about kelp.
10. Being everyone to the dorms and settle them in before meeting the president (whoever that is this week).
11. Ceremonial handshake with retirees

We've been doing tours for about as long as I can remember.
I mean, someone had to do it and the adults were all "busy" (or so they say).

Besides, we were so socially starved, it was fun talking to and learning about the outside from the new residents.
Well, it was fun the first time.
Maybe the first ten times.
But I have to be honest, around twenty or thirty tours in, I was bored out of my mind.

Still, I feel like no matter how many tours we did, you always found a way to enjoy them.
While walking from place to place, you would nudge someone's shoulder and ask where they're from.
Or about technology we are missing on Nemo.
Or what they were looking forward to the most.

At the end of the day, though, there was always an air of awkwardity between us.
Even though TAI translated, we were truly from different worlds.
We were like caged animals to them, entertainment while at the zoo.

Then there was Jake

# This should be a common thread.
# Maybe ask Jake these questions throughout the chapter?
Or why they ran away.

Still, you always managed to be interested.
Stories from the outside were somehow addicting.


Rei and I are doing well.
She's exploring Nemo just like we used to and finding all the old nooks.

We were always told Nemo was special.
That *we* were special.
I know you are, but what am I, you know?

It's hard to date a force of nature.

It's better here.
But how do we know if we don't look around?
But not for me...

Keep repeating "it's better here"
