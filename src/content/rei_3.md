# Your Grandfather

Hey Rei,

It's about time I tell you about your gradfather, Jebediah Brooks.

See, when Nemo started, it was not a researcher's paradise, but an experimental prison.

Due to their crimes, many of their citizenships were revoked and they were forced to the IRR.
They chose Nemo because...
I don't know.
Maybe to atone for their sins?

Your grandfather was one of these.
Actually, all of your grandparents were.

After Joanna and I were born, infrastructure was put in place to give newborn citizens IRR rights, but before then...

"I can't leave because of you..."

I felt guilty because of that.

But it wasn't because of me.
To you, Nemo was a prison.
To me, a paradise.

And you did everything in your power to make sure I felt that way.
