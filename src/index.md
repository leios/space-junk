# What's going on?

This is a freely available draft of my book, *Fishing for Satellites*, a science-fiction novel about a family living in the most remote location on Earth.

All of the written text on this site was created by [James Schloss](https://github.com/leios) and is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC-BY-NC-SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode).
This means that you are free to read, copy, modify, and remix any of the content here with a few key restrictions.
Namely, the new (derivative) work:
1. Cannot make money.
2. Must attribute me (James Schloss or Leios).
3. Must be available for free with a Creative Commons license.

Part of me feels crazy for doing this.
After all, I spent a long time working on this novel with the clear goal of printing and publishing it.
More than that, I intend to use any revenue from this book to hire animators and researchers for various projects.

On the other hand...
Books are basically all available for free at libraries anyway, and several good books that have sold really well are also under Creative Commons licenses.
More than that, if my book is freely available, I can get more direct feedback from a larger number of people and (hopefully) build a framework for translations and other features.

So here is what I ask: **if you enjoy this book or the associated animations on youtube, please consider purchasing *Fishing for Satellites* when it is officially available**.
If you are interested, please [fill out the form here](https://forms.gle/s9y1m8wmyr86ontR8)!

I will set the prices so that I will receive 5 USD back from every purchase.
I also promise that all the revenue will go directly into funding more projects from me (and my eventual team).
If there are enough books purchased, I plan to hire a distribution manager to help reduce the cost of each one as well.
If you do not want a physical copy but would still like to support Leios Labs, I might consider opening up some form of donation link, so let me know if that is something you would like in the [survey](https://forms.gle/s9y1m8wmyr86ontR8).

Outside of that, feel free to leave comments on [github](https://github.com/leios/space-junk/issues/) or otherwise edit the pages directly by clicking the edit button on the upper-right (and then the pencil button on the upper right of the preview on github).
I would love to hear your feedback!

I guess that's all for now.
Thanks for your interest in the novel and Leios Labs!

Peace,  
James (Leios)
