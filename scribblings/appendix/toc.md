To me, research[^ I am using the term "research" here instead of "science" to include mathematics, philosophy, art, and other important areas of learning] is similar to magic in that it allows humanity to go beyond its limitations.
We can fly, dive deep into the ocean, and move at supersonic speeds.
We can destroy nations at the push of a button.
We have the entirety of human knowledge available at our fingertips.

To the untrained eye, this certainly appears to be magic.
But it is not.

It is due to researchers slowly pushing the boundary of human knowledge forward bit by bit through millennia of collaboration and hard work.
More than that, we would not be where we are today without researchers actively and openly communicating their research to their peers and the broader public.
Simply put, research communication is just as important as research, itself.
To me, that is the difference between magic and research: while a good magician never reveals their trick, a good researcher always does.
So here I am, trying to be a good researcher and explain every concept I used in the writing of *Space Junk*.

Make no mistake, *Space Junk* is a work of fiction.
The characters will never exist, and I'm almost certain there will never be any sort of research center at point Nemo.
That said, I did my due diligence to make sure that every piece of technology is at least theoretically possible and has a good reason to exist in the future.
My hope is that the novel has inspired you to learn in some way and that this book, the *Appendix*, can provide enough information to get you started.
If you still want more, then I have curated a list of helpful references for you to keep learning.
So, without any more needless rambling, let's start with the table of contents:
