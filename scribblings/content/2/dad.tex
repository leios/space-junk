\chapter{To Dad}

\noindent Hey Dad,

I don't know where you are right now or what you have been doing with yourself for the past few years, but I've been well.
I mean, sure, Joanne is now out of the picture, but I like to think that I've rebounded since then and tried my best to raise my daughter the same way you raised me: true to ourselves, no matter who that might be.
I know you never met her, but I am sure you would love her almost as much as I do.

She's kind, compassionate, and wickedly smart.
She must get her intelligence from you \sout{or Joanne}, because the Lord knows my IQ is about the same as... \footnote{make a clever joke.} 

It's been so long, there's so much I want to catch you up on, but maybe I should start (as I always do) with a long, rambly story with no discernable purpose.
