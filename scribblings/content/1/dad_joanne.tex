\chapter{What happened to Joanne..}

\noindent Hey Dad,

I'm struggling.

I has taken me a long time to admit this, but I am truly struggling.

When I was growing up, I never really asked what happened to mom.
I don't know why, but I never thought about it.

It was just the two of us.
There was never a third person, nor did I ever feel like we needed someone else.

Looking back, I guess that was a mistake.

I can only imagine you were struggling in the very same way I am now.

Leia smiles when she sees me, and I smile back, but there's an emptiness.

A failure that I can't quite own up to.

A question that Leia might ask that will shake me to my core: ``Where's mom?''

Ok, ok. I'll write the letter.
