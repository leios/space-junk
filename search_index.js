We often think of the passage time as constant: minutes turn to hours, and then to days, years, and decades. A second is always a second, no matter how we measure it.

Jake would then call out, \"Come on in! The water's great!\" Of course, he had been wearing his suit underneath his clothes all day, as he always did. We had not. So I'd always fold his shirt and sit at the dock while you fussed about whether you should jump in with him or not. You never did.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_1_2/","page":"No lab before 5 AM","title":"No lab before 5 AM","text":"We'd just sit there and chat for hours. – Sometimes, we'd convince Jake to get out after a lot of effort.

Well, to be honest, I don't know if that one was a memory or a dream. I'm still wondering which is which, because when I opened my eyes, there was actually someone sitting beside me.

This location is right in the middle of the South Pacific Gyre, which is a large region of the South pacific ocean spanning from the coasts of Chile to New Zealand, Antarctica, and the equator.

Basically, because this area is so devoid of life, large spacecrafts are sent here when they are out of commission and need to re-enter Earth's atmosphere.\nIt is the location of the South Pacific garbage patch. Essentially, a large portion of the plastic polluted into the oceans from the surrounding land mass ends up here.

There are certain ideas that I am fairly confident will become game-changers in the future: Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Alternative Energies, and so on; however, there will be several things no one can predict. Part of the beuty of setting this book at Point Nemo is that I can force my characters to rely on a relatively low amount of technology as most of the tools will be hyper-specific to their living environment.\nSpace Commerce will increase. This means that more satellites will be landing in the Spacecraft Cemetary around Point Nemo, but also means that there is a higher risk for Kessler Syndrome to take hold. This is caused by satellites running into each other and creating a cloud of space debris that then collides with more satellites, breaking them as well. Eventually, there is a chain reaction and most of the satellites a certain distance from the Earth will be completely destroyed.\nClimate Change will affect us. It's really hard to say exactly how much the climate will change in the next hundred years, but we can be certain of a temperature increase – especially in the ocean. This will cause sea levels to rise and certain terrestrial areas around the equator to become uninhabitable. This will likely cause refugees to flee to nearby countries; however, in this theoretical world, there is another place for certain refugees to go: the research refuge. This is essentially a borderless country goverened by the United Nations where people go to inhabit uninhabitable places (antarctica, the middle of the ocean, etc) as research expiditions.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_3/#The-Existence-Party","page":"The Existence Party","title":"The Existence Party","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"content/joanne_3/","page":"The Existence Party","title":"The Existence Party","text":"Hey Joanne,","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_3/","page":"The Existence Party","title":"The Existence Party","text":"The moment Joanne got her passport, Lars began to recognize that she might leave.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_3/","page":"The Existence Party","title":"The Existence Party","text":"We had another existence party for Rei the other day.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_3/","page":"The Existence Party","title":"The Existence Party","text":"I am happy to say that after years of paperwork, Rei now has her passport as well and can leave whenever she chooses.
