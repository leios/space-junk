I don't know what I was feeling, exactly. Maybe it was pride for my daughter who took initiative to either stay up late or get up early to solve a complex problem.

Now let's say you stick that rope in your pocket and go for a run. When you get back, the rope will be all twisted around and tangled, but if you carefully take your time, you can untangle everything back to the original circle. That process of unknotting an unknot is precisely how it feels to decipher any conversation with Rei. It's a bit of an agonizing process, but when it's all over, everything feels simple.

This means that more satellites will be landing in the Spacecraft Cemetary around Point Nemo, but also means that there is a higher risk for Kessler Syndrome to take hold. This is caused by satellites running into each other and creating a cloud of space debris that then collides with more satellites, breaking them as well. Eventually, there is a chain reaction and most of the satellites a certain distance from the Earth will be completely destroyed.\nClimate Change will affect us. It's really hard to say exactly how much the climate will change in the next hundred years, but we can be certain of a temperature increase – especially in the ocean. This will cause sea levels to rise and certain terrestrial areas around the equator to become uninhabitable. This will likely cause refugees to flee to nearby countries; however, in this theoretical world, there is another place for certain refugees to go: the research refuge.

Lo and behold [^What a phrase! I should use that more often!]! We found you, scribbling alone on a tablet. You were facing the other direction, so I don't think you knew we were there.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/lars_1/","page":"The Bubble","title":"The Bubble","text":"Micheal sent some texts to me through TAI, asking if we should knock or not, but before he did, I motioned for him to stop and hacked into your glasses to see your AR screens. In that moment, I saw the entire inner surface of the bubble scribbled on with a mix of just about everything I could think of: equations, graphs, spreadsheets, and a bunch of written text. There was also an entier map of the seafloor for the south pacific gyre, colored in red, green, and blue. It was, frankly, the least organized dashboard I had ever seen.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/lars_1/","page":"The Bubble","title":"The Bubble","text":"At the time, I couldn't quite figure out what you were doing and decided to snoop a bit by peeking over your shoulder and on to your tablet. I was surprised to see you writing a letter to Grampa Jeb. I realized we were maybe peeking in on something we shouldn't have seen and texted Micheal to follow me as we kept swam away. To this day, I don't know if you even knew we were there.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/lars_1/","page":"The Bubble","title":"The Bubble","text":"Sorry for spying.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/lars_1/","page":"The Bubble","title":"The Bubble","text":"Still, I spent years thinking about that moment.
