Nemo is located at the center of a large, slow moving, rotational current known as the South Pacific gyre. This means two things:Because there is no current moving nutrients in to the gyre, it ends up being lifeless. No plants. No fish. Nothing.\nBecause there is no current moving out of the gyre, whatever ends up floating inside typically stays there and drifts towards the center.This is why there is a giant floating island of plastic in the middle of the north and south Pacific.On the one hand, the south Pacific is known for having the bluest waters on Earth. On the other hand, it's an \"Oceanic desert,\" barren and lifeless outside of a few ancient bacteria in the ocean floor. The least habitable place on Earth.A century ago, it would have been impossible to imagine living in such an environment, but with overpopulation and the climate crisis, people got desperate, so here we are.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/#The-stories","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"The stories","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"J: \"No one's cute in a scuba suit.\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"L: \"Ah, that's true, I guess?\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"J:","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"L: What?","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"J: \"You were supposed to say something like, 'you make it work.' or something.\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"L: Ah, right.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"J: Well?","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"L: You make it work or something.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"J: You're the worst!","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"L: I keep telling you that you can do better!","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"J: Well, Jake was busy training for the Olympics...","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_2/","page":"You know that's impossible.","title":"You know that's impossible.","text":"L: Ah, so what you're telling me is that you can't do better?

Basically, because this area is so devoid of life, large spacecrafts are sent here when they are out of commission and need to re-enter Earth's atmosphere.\nIt is the location of the South Pacific garbage patch. Essentially, a large portion of the plastic polluted into the oceans from the surrounding land mass ends up here.

There are certain ideas that I am fairly confident will become game-changers in the future: Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Alternative Energies, and so on; however, there will be several things no one can predict. Part of the beuty of setting this book at Point Nemo is that I can force my characters to rely on a relatively low amount of technology as most of the tools will be hyper-specific to their living environment.\nSpace Commerce will increase. This means that more satellites will be landing in the Spacecraft Cemetary around Point Nemo, but also means that there is a higher risk for Kessler Syndrome to take hold. This is caused by satellites running into each other and creating a cloud of space debris that then collides with more satellites, breaking them as well. Eventually, there is a chain reaction and most of the satellites a certain distance from the Earth will be completely destroyed.\nClimate Change will affect us. It's really hard to say exactly how much the climate will change in the next hundred years, but we can be certain of a temperature increase – especially in the ocean. This will cause sea levels to rise and certain terrestrial areas around the equator to become uninhabitable. This will likely cause refugees to flee to nearby countries; however, in this theoretical world, there is another place for certain refugees to go: the research refuge. This is essentially a borderless country goverened by the United Nations where people go to inhabit uninhabitable places (antarctica, the middle of the ocean, etc) as research expiditions.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_3/#The-mangroves","page":"The mangroves","title":"The mangroves","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"content/joanne_3/","page":"The mangroves","title":"The mangroves","text":"This deals with ","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_3/","page":"The mangroves","title":"The mangroves","text":"Recycle as much plastic as possible from the southern Pacific garbage patch [2].","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_3/","page":"The mangroves","title":"The mangroves","text":"[2]: This is potentially a reasonable request.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/joanne_3/","page":"The mangroves","title":"The mangroves","text":"Humans litter.
