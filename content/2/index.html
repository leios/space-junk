Diligently clearing every inch of my bubble to make sure I could work in peace.</p><p>When I was a teenager, I would often come home late. Not super late, but late enough that dinner was cold and waiting for me on the table. Not only that, but the dishes were done, the floors were swept, and the house was tidy.</p><p>Do you remember the Bubble? The kelp observation deck under the processing facility? There were a bunch of other observation decks, but this was one of the first ones built, so it has a bunch of weird quirks. It was before the architects thought of the buoyancy well design to keep Nemo floating, so it was basically just a hemisphere that dipped into the water so people could watch the kelp grow. It&#39;s also almost entirely abandoned and impossible to find.</p><p>I guess after years of population growth, the processing facility suffered from what can only be described as building puberty, leaving little nooks that were never touched by anyone anymore. That particular nook was mine though. It was the only place I could go to truly be alone.</p><p>To be honest, I think you might have been the only other person to go there.</p><p>...</p><p>Sorry.

I mean, sure, Joanne is effectively out of the picture, but I really don&#39;t mind the single parent life too much. Rei&#39;s great. I know you&#39;ve never met her, but I am sure you would love her almost as much as I do.</p><p>She&#39;s kind, compassionate, and wickedly smart.

Who cares? I&#39;m only writing these because Tai said it might be good for me to do so. No one&#39;s going to read this anyway [^ Sorry.].</p><p>It&#39;s been so long. There&#39;s so much I want to catch you up on, but maybe I should start (as I always do) with a long, rambly story with no discernable purpose.</p><p>To be honest, I don&#39;t remember when this happened, but it was rather cold outside, so maybe July or August? It doesn&#39;t matter, we don&#39;t need to get bogged down with the details here.</p><p>The point is that it was cold and I was a teenager.</p><p>Being a teenager is hard. On the one hand, you are smart enough to realize that you have autonomy and can do just about anything you want. On the other hand, you have no idea what you want to actually do.</p><p>I don&#39;t really know why, but after Joanne, Jake and I spent most of the day goofing around, I needed to just sit somewhere to relax and recharge myself. I had a number of different hiding spots, but my favorite was the kelp observation deck. It was a bit hidden away, so you might not remember it. There was a little basement door near the processing facility that would lead to a bubble under the water so people could check in on the quality of the kelp.</p><p>Keeping it clean was a small passion project of mine. Actually, I haven&#39;t been there in some time. Give me a second.</p><p>...</p><p>Man, talk about deja vu! I took a day off from writing to visit the old kelp deck.</p><p>It took me a while because some student covered up the entrance with an AR [^Augmented Reality] board. After I moved it away and opened the hatch, I was hit with the most nostalgic musty smell, but as I walked down the stairs, I noticed something unusual: it was pitch black. At that time of day, there should have been at least a little light filtering through from the outside. But yesterday, nothing. It was completely overwhelmed by moss.</p><p>I then just laughed. No one ever cleaned the bubble except me. Heck, I&#39;m convinced no one else even knows it exists besides the two of us.</p><p>So I fumbled around and found my old squeegie and suit, stripped off my clothes then and there and got ready for a snorkel. Even though the diving pad was a considerable distance from the bubble, and the kelp had grown a significant amount since my last visit, I still found my way there without any trouble. The moss was crazy!</p><p>Back in the day, it would only take an hour at most to clean everything, but yesterday it took all afternoon and then some! I had to come back in the evening with a light to finish up the job. Honestly, I should have brought an oxygen tank, but it was a good workout to bob up and down on the surface. Now that the sun&#39;s up today, I can see a bunch of missed green patches on the outside of the bubble, but I think it&#39;s ok for now.</p><p>There was something about scraping all the moss away and watching it drift to the ocean floor that felt really relaxing. I&#39;m just been so mindlessly busy recently. Fixing boats, signing documents, lecturing students... None of it really felt, real? Like, there was a sort of haze around everything I did that kept me from really enjoying my day-to-day.</p><p>Agency. Maybe that&#39;s what I have been missing. Everything I do, I do to help others. But yesterday, when I was cleaning my own little bubble, I felt satisfied in a way I hadn&#39;t in years.</p><p>When I was younger, I&#39;d just kinda stare through my goggles at the bubble from the outside. If you lined up your vision just right, it would do that infinite mirror thing where there were like a thousand copies of you bouncing back and forth to infinity. I tried to do that again yesterday, but never quite got it right I almost saw it. Every time I scraped off the moss, I would look directly at the bubble, hoping to see it, but just missed it every time. I couldn&#39;t remember the exact lighting necessary to get it to work, but it had something to do with the time of day, and I guess I just missed the right window.</p><p>But this morning, just before getting back to writing, I decided to get to the bottom of things and blow a few ring bubbles. I used to be able to get them to be perfectly symmetric around the bubble&#39;s base. Today, well, not so much. To be honest, my lung capacity is shot and I could hardly get my hands in position to make the ring bubble in the first place. But I got the infinite mirror thing to work at least. Well, &quot;infinite&quot; might be a bit of a stretch, but I got a few reflections back and forth and that was good enough for me.</p><p>Man I&#39;m old. Not as old as you, but still. Old.</p><p>Now that I&#39;m sitting here, alone and dripping a bit with my notebook in hand, I feel like the kelp deck is a perfect symbol for Nemo. The settlement is filled with a bunch of ideas that only kinda work and only when people put in the leg work to make them work. On the other hand, &quot;Kinda working&quot; is way better than broken.</p><p>That&#39;s a good one, I should write that one down.</p><p>What were we even talking about here?</p><p>Right, teenage angst.</p><p>#–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––#</p><h1 id="Snippets"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Snippets">Snippets</a><a id="Snippets-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Snippets" title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>#–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––#</p><p>But Joanne used to always say that was the beauty of humanity. When we push, we can make things happen.</p><p>Still, sitting here now, I&#39;m happy enough with my work. I mean, sure, things are a bit grean, but my glasses can fix that. Right now, I&#39;ve got my pen, my notebook, and a bottle of water. Just like old times.</p><p>Speaking of, time to ramble (as if I hadn&#39;t been already).</p><p>&quot;I just looked for the most remote place I could think of.&quot; I then realized how much work you must have done to find me there.</p><p>In true Nemoian fashion, the That might be why no else ever stopped by. Well, no one except for you.</p><p>In fact...</p><p>I just moved to be there now. I haven&#39;t been here in a while, so it&#39;s a little dusty, but it&#39;s basically the same as I remember.
