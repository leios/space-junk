\chapter*{Some quick notes...}

This novel is a piece of fiction -- in particular \textit{science} fiction, but I will do my best to distinguish between the science and fiction while writing.

This means that anyone is free to use this work for anything they like, so long as it is not for a commercial purpose and any derivative works have the same license and attribute me, Dr. James Schloss (Leios)}.

I think that's all for now.
Please enjoy the novel!
