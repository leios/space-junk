Not one of those huge monumental mistakes that cause your entire life to spiral out of control. A smaller one. One so subtle that even in hindsight, I&#39;m not really sure what I could have done differently.</p><p>A few days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night. I am not quite sure what the time was, maybe two or three in the morning? It doesn&#39;t matter. The point is that no matter how much I tossed and turned, I simply could not get back to sleep. So I instead got up, slipped on my shoes, and started to walk while daydreaming at night.</p><p>I was truly exhausted. It felt like my bones were moving while my muscles lagged behind, and I unconsciously swayed to and fro. I hadn&#39;t felt that way since Rei used to wake up in the middle of the night as a toddler.</p><p>Somehow, I found myself wandering along the same path. The bench where she&#39;d stash all her toys. The kitchen where we&#39;d make a midnight snack. The dock where we&#39;d dip our toes in the water. Places where a baby could babble without waking anyone.</p><p>Now, hear me out. We often think of the passage time as constant: minutes turn to hours, and then to days, years, and decades. A second is always a second, no matter how we measure it. But I really feel like there are nearly universal human experiences that contradict this notion. The mornings after a hard night of work. An afternoon spent deeply engrossed in a good book. Late nights spent scrolling through the internet with an incredibly important deadline looming in the near future.</p><p>In these moments, time seems to change. If you look at the clock and blink, hours could pass. Or the opposite might be true: it could feel like hours pass between each tick of the clock.</p><p>– That night, while sitting at the dock and splashing with my feet, I feel like I found another one of those experiences. I could not tell you what happened next. I guess I had a few small dreams about us. You, me, and Jake.</p><p>Sometimes, we&#39;d be walking and talking near the dock and suddenly, without warning, I would hear a loud splash from the water and feel a dirty shirt fall over my head. Jake would then call out, &quot;Come on in! The water&#39;s great!&quot; Of course, he had been wearing his suit underneath his clothes all day, as he always did. We had not. So I&#39;d always fold his shirt and sit at the dock while you fussed about whether you should jump in with him or not. You never did.</p><p>We&#39;d just sit there and chat for hours. – Sometimes, we&#39;d convince Jake to get out after a lot of effort. Sometimes, we&#39;d be called out by my dad for dinner. Sometimes, we&#39;d stay there till the satellites came out. If we were lucky, even the stars.</p><p>Man, that night. While I sat there alone. The stars were so bright. I actually had to shield my eyes from the moon.</p><p>I felt like every time I blinked, I would find a new memory I had long forgotten. The time we accidentally ruined half the samples in the ocean lab. The time we went on an adventure by searching for Jake, only to find he was at home all day. The time it was just the two of us. I was lying down. You were sitting at the edge of the dock with your feet in the water.</p><p>Then. Well, to be honest, I don&#39;t know if that one was a memory or a dream. I&#39;m still wondering which is which, because when I opened my eyes, there was actually someone sitting beside me. She was kicking a bit in the water, while leaning back and resting on her hands, staring off into space and humming slightly. The only problem was that it wasn&#39;t you. It was Rei.</p><p>And it was, what? Four in the morning?</p><p>In that moment, I knew what I had to do. I had to be a good, stern father and send her off to bed. After all, she was a growing teenage girl who needed her sleep. I was planning on sitting up, grabbing her by the hand and saying, &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get back to bed.&quot;</p><p>But then she started murmuring a bit to herself. Her hands started waving a bit in the air, and I realized she was using her glasses [^augmented reality glasses that project monitors into space for those wearing them] to reason about a problem. I silently laid there, pretending to sleep while trying to figure out what she was thinking about.</p><p>Now. You know how I&#39;m a deeply flawed individual who basically never gets anything right? Well, one of my many flaws is that I can never quite get my emotions in check. I should have been frustrated. Tired due to my own lack of sleep. Annoyed at Rei for being up at an unreasonable hour. – ...</p><p>But I wasn&#39;t upset at all. I don&#39;t know what I was feeling, exactly. Pride for my daughter who took initiative to either stay up late or get up early to solve a complex problem. Happiness that she hadn&#39;t started her teenage rebelious phase and was still willing to hang out with an old man like me. –  Without realizing it, a smile crept up on my face and I chuckled to myself.</p><p>She turned to me and said, &quot;Good. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re awake...&quot; And I blinked.</p><p>Then we were somehow in the lab.</p><p>The lights were red. To be honest, I initially thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I blinked again and the lights remained red. While Rei was rummaging in one of the drawers, I asked about it, and she said, &quot;Well, you told me &#39;no blue light at night.&#39; So I put a film on all the lights after ten or so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right, but the reason we told you not to use blue light at night was because it would keep you up. If you are already awake, then you might as well keep the normal lights on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Great thanks!&quot; While still fumbling around for something, she opened another drawer and pressed a button. With a beep, all the lights were normal again, and she said, &quot;I knew you would understand. I thought it was a safety risk using only red light in lab anyway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, wait.&quot; At ths point, I realized there was no helping it. My daughter – out daughter – is nothing short of a force of nature. She must get that from Jake.</p><p>Finally, she finished searching for whatever it was that she was looking for and prodiced a new pair of AR lenses from the drawer. ...</p><p>I blinked again, and it was morning.</p><p>I must have dozed off a bit because the next thing I knew, I was jolted awake by the sound of rustling in the water. It was something like four in the morning and another person was sitting next to me. I bet you can guess who it was.</p><p>Now, look. I do my best to be a good father. I do all the cooking and cleaning. I am try to participate in all of her hobbies. I try to discipline her when appropriate.</p><p>Yet, that night, I just couldn&#39;t help but laugh. I tried to cover my face with my hands while rubbing my temples and acted gumpy, &quot;You should be in bed.&quot;</p><p>She just laid down next to me, mimicking my posture with her feet in the water and started talking. &quot;You know how TAI is the &#39;Translator Artificial Intelligence&#39;? Yet it kinda does everything? Like, we just put on our glasses, talk, and then TAI automatically translates everything into the right language for everyone else?&quot;</p><p>Ok. Right. Gotta be a good father. &quot;Rei. You should be sleeping.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dad. You need to focus.&quot; She tapped my arm before continuing, &quot;Well, I thought to myself, &#39;Hey. This is a great tool for learning new languages!&#39; All we need to do is get two TAIs. One speaks in English, the other in whatever language we want to learn.&quot;</p><p>I couldn&#39;t help smiling a bit, but knew I had to put my foot down. &quot;Rei. Can&#39;t this wait until morning?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. No. Dad. You don&#39;t understand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ok. What don&#39;t I understand?&quot;</p><p>Joanne. I am so sorry. It was then that I realized I am a bad father. I don&#39;t know what happened after I asked that question, but we were suddenly in the lab. It was relatively clean, all things considered. Just a few screwdrivers strewn about. But, &quot;Hey. Rei. Why are the lights red?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, you said, &#39;no blue light after midnight&#39; because it keeps me up or something, so I put a film over the lights around that time every night.&quot; Shewas now rummaging through a drawer while finishing her sentence, &quot;See? I listen.&quot;</p><p>What&#39;s the point in the red light if she&#39;s up anyway? It&#39;s fine. I decided to focus on something else, &quot;Wait. Rei. How often are you awake at this time?&quot;</p><p>She just laughed at me. The fake laugh. The one you do when you are hiding something. &quot;Oh Dad. You are so funny.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. Rei. Look.&quot; OK. OK. Be a good dad. Put your foot down.</p><p>&quot;Ok, found them.&quot; She pulled out a pair of Augmented Reality glasses. &quot;Ok. Promise you won&#39;t be mad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rei.&quot; I rubbed at my temples again, trying to hide my own smile. Be a good dad. Be a good dad. &quot;I&#39;m furious. At what though?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I think I might have broken your glasses.&quot; It was then that I noticed the lenses she had were, indeed, mine. &quot;To update TAI, I needed to flash a new OS onto some AR lenses. Obviously, to do that, I needed another pair to test things on. I mean, I wasn&#39;t dumb enough to do things <em>blind</em>. So one pair for reading up on the wiki. The other pair for testing. I wasn&#39;t about to use <em>my</em> lenses for testing. I need those.&quot;</p><p>And here was my mistake. I just broke. I am sorry. The two of us laughed together for a few minutes at the absurdity of the situation. It was an ungodly hour in the morning where every sane person should be sleeping. But we were not quite sane. We were zombies in a lab together. Finally, I said the truth, &quot;Honestly, Rei. I&#39;m impressed. How broken are they? I need them for a tour in the morning&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I hate to break it to you dad, but it <em>is</em> the morning.&quot; She then twirled them around in her hand before saying, &quot;And yeah. They are completely, 100% bricked.&quot;</p><p>We spent the remainder of the morning fixing them up and getting them working again. When the sun rose, Rei took the red film off the lights. A few hours later, we had the glasses working again.</p><p>I put them on and began setting them up like they always were.</p><p>I then patted her on the back and said, &quot;Next time your up, wake me up too. I&#39;m happy to supervise you whenever you want.&quot;</p><p>And see. That&#39;s how I know I still need you here. You would have talked at least a little sense into us.</p><p>But no. Now Rei wakes me up at like two or three every morning for these morning lab sessions.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry. We go to bed at like 7, so we&#39;re still sleeping enough.</p><p>Now you might think to yourself, &quot;Ok. The guy stayed up late with his daughter and helped her with a hobby of hers, no big deal, right?&quot;</p><p>Ohoho. No. See, the reason I needed the glasses the next day was that new researchers were arriving and I am (still) doing basically all the tours. Rei helps nowadays, but I am the first point-of-contact.</p><p>Rei then exclaimed, &quot;It worked!&quot;</p><p>But that wasn&#39;t the issue.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.2.1 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Monday 11 March 2024 10:16">Monday 11 March 2024</span>.
