We can fly, dive deep into the ocean, and move at supersonic speeds. We can destroy nations at the push of a button. We have the entirety of human knowledge available at our fingertips.</p><p>To the untrained eye, this certainly appears to be magic. But it is not.</p><p>It is due to researchers slowly pushing the boundary of human knowledge forward bit by bit through millennia of collaboration and hard work. More than that, we would not be where we are today without researchers actively and openly communicating their research to their peers and the broader public. Simply put, research communication is just as important as research, itself. To me, that is the difference between magic and research: while a good magician never reveals their trick, a good researcher always does.</p><p>That said, this is ultiamtely a work of science fiction set roughly one hundred years in the future. As much as I would love to gush for hours about specific fish variety that could live int eh south pacific gyre or the different ways to deorbit spacecrafts, I know that the best way to teach is not to lecture, but inspire learning. For this reason, I&#39;ve decided to only add supporting details where necessary for everyone to better understand the story. Rest assured, none of these details will be necessary to understand the plot, but they will certainly give you a fuller picture of the world.</p><p>for now, I will very briefly talk about the location of <em>Space Junk</em> and some core assumptions I made when predicting the future.</p><h2 id="The-most-remote-location-on-Earth"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-most-remote-location-on-Earth">The most remote location on Earth</a><a id="The-most-remote-location-on-Earth-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-most-remote-location-on-Earth" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p><em>Space Junk</em> is set on the most remote location on Earth, otherwise known as Point Nemo. This location is right in the middle of the South Pacific Gyre, which is a large region of the South pacific ocean spanning from the coasts of Chile to New Zealand, Antarctica, and the equator. Due to the difference in rotational speed at the equator and the poles of the Earth, there is a relatively slow-moving ocean current that rotates counter-clockwise around the entire region.</p><p>Overall, this location is quite interesting because:</p><ol><li>It is the single location on Earth that is furthest away from any other human civilization. In fact, if you find yourself stranded at this location, you might be closer to the astronauts on the International Space Station than anyone anywhere on Earth.</li><li>It is in the middle of a large, oceanic desert and is sometimes called the &quot;deadest place on Earth.&quot; Even though the waters are essentially toxic to life, there still exists microbial life which has been undisturbed at the bottom of the ocean for perhaps hundreds of millions of years [^ CITE: Aerobic microbial life persists in oxic marine sediment as old as 101.5 million years] </li><li>It is the location of the Spacecraft Cemetary. Basically, because this area is so devoid of life, large spacecrafts are sent here when they are out of commission and need to re-enter Earth&#39;s atmosphere.</li><li>It is the location of the South Pacific garbage patch. Essentially, a large portion of the plastic polluted into the oceans from the surrounding land mass ends up here. Due to the sun and ocean waves, teh plastic is ground up into microscopic particles that are hard to detect properly, but they are still clearly present...</li></ol><p>For all of these reason, Point Nemo is an excellent location to think about the future. Speaking of the future...</p><h2 id="Prediction-is-truly-impossible"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Prediction-is-truly-impossible">Prediction is truly impossible</a><a id="Prediction-is-truly-impossible-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Prediction-is-truly-impossible" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Science fiction is a subgenre of &quot;speculative fiction,&quot; which inherently means that the authors are speculating (sometimes wildly) about how real human characters might respond to particular events. In my case, I did everything in my power to keep this work <em>mostly</em> within the realm of possibilities; however, it is truly impossible to predict the future to any degree of certainty.</p><p>Sure, I can read papers and guess where the general trends in technology will be in a few years, but that intuition quickly dissapears when discussing timescales over a few decades at most. More than that, I have no idea what the political or economic landscapes will be like. While writing this book, I periodically interrupted the narrative flow to talk about very specific scientific details and ideas; however, I think it&#39;s important to talk now about my general guiding principles to transform our world into that of Space Junk:</p><ol><li>Technology will advance in ways we cannot comprehend now. There are certain ideas that I am fairly confident will become game-changers in the future: Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Alternative Energies, and so on; however, there will be several things no one can predict. Part of the beuty of setting this book at Point Nemo is that I can force my characters to rely on a relatively low amount of technology as most of the tools will be hyper-specific to their living environment.</li><li>Space Commerce will increase. This means that more satellites will be landing in the Spacecraft Cemetary around Point Nemo, but also means that there is a higher risk for Kessler Syndrome to take hold. This is caused by satellites running into each other and creating a cloud of space debris that then collides with more satellites, breaking them as well. Eventually, there is a chain reaction and most of the satellites a certain distance from the Earth will be completely destroyed.</li><li>Climate Change will affect us. It&#39;s really hard to say exactly how much the climate will change in the next hundred years, but we can be certain of a temperature increase – especially in the ocean. This will cause sea levels to rise and certain terrestrial areas around the equator to become uninhabitable. This will likely cause refugees to flee to nearby countries; however, in this theoretical world, there is another place for certain refugees to go: the research refuge. This is essentially a borderless country goverened by the United Nations where people go to inhabit uninhabitable places (antarctica, the middle of the ocean, etc) as research expiditions.</li></ol></article><nav class="docs-footer"><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.2.1 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Monday 11 March 2024 10:16">Monday 11 March 2024</span>.
