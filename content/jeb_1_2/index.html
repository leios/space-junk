This chapter is about lars cleaning the bubble and reminiscing about the time he was found by Jeb</p><p>Hey Dad,</p><p>The other day, I (somewhat accidentally) introduced Rei to the Bubble while we were looking for some equipment. At this point, I think we are the only two people on the island that know it even exists. It was an essentially untouched time capsule, complete with a collection of all my old stories. I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll have any reason to go back. I don&#39;t have any reason to either.</p><p>Yet I&#39;m here in the Bubble right now, writing something no one will ever read. Just like I always have. For the past few hours, I&#39;ve been ignoring all my work and sifting through my old drives. I can&#39;t explain why I came back. Maybe there doesn&#39;t need to be a reason. Too much logic ruins a good story.</p><p>Did you know I had written a book about a civilization without the concept of language? It was so hard to write in English. You know, a <em>language</em>. I also did a word count on that crazy series I tried to write. Over one million words. I have read through so many letters. To you. Joanne. Myself.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how to express the emotions I am feeling right now.</p><p>Children dream childish dreams. They pick up sticks and pretend they are swords while role-playing as heroes who never existed. Every thing on Earth is there as a prop in their own story. But as they grow older, they stash all their sticks and stones in a box and leave it to rot somewhere, never to be seen again.</p><p>Soon, every day turns into a constant stream of nearly unsolvable problems. A boat&#39;s leaking. A typhoon&#39;s on the way. Fred still can&#39;t figure out how to connect to the intranet after the fifteenth time and IT is too busy to help him, so you need to spend an hour with him to solve an issue specific to his unique configuration of his glasses. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Fred&#39;s great. It just feels like no one has the time or patience to let you breathe.</p><p>Eventually, your head is down. All you can think of is slowly checking off each individual item on your own mountain of tasks. You can&#39;t remember the last time you even looked someone in the eye.</p><p>And then you find that collection of sticks. It&#39;s not like life was easier as a child. There were always things to do, especially on Nemo. But there was a time when I could think. There was a time when I could write. There was a time I was the main character in my own story.</p><p>I had so much hope when I was younger. I guess that was one of the many childish things I threw away.</p><p>I feel like here, in this old moldy bubble, I can finally breath. Actually, looking at it, there&#39;s a lot of mold. So much, in fact, that I am probably going to get cancer just by being here. Nevertheless, I tried polising the glass a bit to see through the algae and watch the kelp grow for a moment. All I saw was an old man. Raccoon eyes. Unkempt facial hair. Glasses that don&#39;t quite fit on my face.</p><p>And a small box in the corner of the room with my fins and a squeegie. I&#39;ll continue this later. I have some cleaning to do.</p><p>...</p><p>I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s been. Maybe a few weeks? It doesn&#39;t matter. A lot happened in the meantime. I guess I&#39;ll start at the start.</p><p>Immediately after I put up my pen and writing tablet, I got to cleaning. The Bubble&#39;s essentially at the surface of the water, so when I was younger, I would just put on some jammers and fins and dip beneath the surface to clean the outside.  It would take maybe half an hour and I did it once or twice a month. To be honest, I remember really enjoying my time. On Nemo, almost everything is a shared resource, so it was nice to take care of something that was exclusively your own. I would get into a sort of zen state and play music in my head while slowly scraping off the algae.</p><p>This time, it didn&#39;t take thirty minutes.  It took a week. In fact, it took almost a full day for me to find my jammers. And then another day to put them on. As I mde my way from the kelp facility to our house, I was followed by a swarm of people all needing my help with specific problems. I don&#39;t remember all the details. I think that was when the solar panels were starting to go offline? Or maybe it was NORAD <sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="citeref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> detecting another internet brownout? There was something big happening. By the time I got in the door, the sun was already down and Rei was sleeping soundly. I didn&#39;t have the heart to turn a light on and wake her up while rummaging for a swim suit I couldn&#39;t even use until the next day. Besides, due to circumstances outside of my control, we both get up at five in the morning now, so it was time for bed.</p><p>Before going out the next day, I found the jammers and tried them on. I guess I should have counted myself lucky that they still somehow fit. I didn&#39;t have much more time before being called to lab, so I took them off again and rushed to work. Again, I have no idea what I did. Something so important that I forgot, I guess. But I didn&#39;t have a free moment that day either to clean the Bubble.</p><p>The next day, I took a page out of Jake&#39;s book and kept the Jammers on unfer my normal clothes. He still swears by them being the best underwear for any occasion. I mean, they are essentially boxers, just tighter and more water resistant.</p><p>No matter the case, I was determined. I got through everything as quickly as possible, trying to find the opportunity to rush over to the kelp facility and get to cleaning. I mean, it would take half an hour. Surely, I had half an hour of time, right?</p><p>At around three o&#39; clock, I had finished up some maintainence on one of the boats and sat there for a quick breather while dangling my feet off the dock. It was time. I stood up and jogged my way towards the bubble. While on my way, I heard a series of footsteps approaching me quickly from behind. The problem was that without turning around, I already knew exactly who it was. The only person to walk around a research lab without shoes on of any kind. Jake.</p><p>So I sighed, slowed down, and cursed a bit under my breath while staring at some cloud off in the distance. I couldn&#39;t outrun an Olympian.</p><p>I know you haven&#39;t seen Jake in a while, but his fashion sense has only gotten worse. On this occasion, he was wearing a &quot;lab coat&quot; that was actually just a bathrobe he wore around lab. It was completely open in the front, showcasing his abs and neon pink jammers. As I said before, no shoes. Goggles as a necklace. Swim cap tucked away in one of his pockets. This guy.</p><p>He tapped my shoulders, &quot;Yo, Lars. Long time no see. How&#39;ve you been?&quot;</p><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. Jake&#39;s great. There is no other person on the planet that I am closer to. But in that moment, I really just wanted to clean, so I tried to shake him off. &quot;Yeah, alright. I was just off to...&quot;</p><p>He cut me off, &quot;The pool&#39;s actually been moved. It&#39;s over that way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait.&quot; I paused for a second. &quot;Why do you think I am going to the pool?&quot;</p><p>He smiled, nodded his head upwards and raised his eyebrows while also eyeing the edge of my shorts, where my own pair of jammers peaked out a bit. He then said, &quot;I never thought the Jam bros would be back in action. I thought you were too busy!&quot;</p><p>I sighed a bit. I could not express the guilt I had felt in that moment. I had actually been flaking on him at every opportunity for the past few years. We barely spoke. So rather than disappoint him again, I faked a smile back and said, &quot;Well, you caught me. Where&#39;s the pool now?&quot;</p><p>On</p><p>Immediately after I put up my pen and writing tablet, I got to cleaning. When I was younger, I would put on some jammers and fins and dive down to wipe the algae off while holding my breath. The Bubble&#39;s essentially on the surface of the water, so dipping beneath the surface wasn&#39;t too challenging. Back in the day, I would do it once every other week and it would take 30 minutes.</p><p>So I tried to do the same thing I always used to. I am not sure if this was a mistake or not, but it did reinforce a recurring theme in my life right now: I am old.</p><p>It&#39;s been a few weeks.</p><p>I had this issue when I was younger. Jake said to swim. Joanne started talking about how we <em>still</em> don&#39;t know how long whales can actually live in the wild. For some reason.</p><p>I never once told them about the bubble.</p><p>There&#39;s something here about how he feels constantly needed... Youth was simple, the room is simple. He needed to clean.</p><p>Somehow, in this damp, moldy room, I feel like I can breathe freely. But I do know that the place was a mess. No dust, but the floor was essentially a carpet of wires. My cabinet also needed to be sorted. I had no idea what kind of stuff my past self stashed away.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s just pure nostalgia. Maybe it&#39;s because I felt the urge to clean up after myself. Maybe there&#39;s no logical reason at all.</p><p>It was a mess... no dust because no one else had been here, but a bunch of algae... Luckily, I found my old fins and squeegie in a box, so I spent the better hal of the day cleaning.</p><p>Out of breath Train with Jake.</p><p>Lars, PS: I tried training with Jake and he whooped me pretty good. Not going to try that again.</p><p>...</p><p>I don&#39;t know. The way I see it, children have childish dreams. They&#39;ll pick up sticks and treat them as swords, role-playing as heroes that never existed. Jake&#39;s dream was to be an olympic swimmer. He did that. Joanne wanted to be a wildlife biologist. She did that.</p><p>So why am I the only one who had to grow up? Why can&#39;t I be a child again?</p><p>There is a cabinet down here with all my old files. I&#39;ve really enjoyed going through all the stories. There&#39;s one ...</p><p>...</p><p>Be right back. ... Ok, it&#39;s the next day.</p><p>The other day, Rei and I went to the bubble. It was a mess...</p><p>No matter where you go in life, the first step always feels wrong. The first step of every journey is often a huge mistake. ...</p><p>I will often times find myself rolling around my bed, unable to sleep due to stupid things I have done in the past.</p><p>Maybe it is because of this cringing feeling that I try to distance myself from my past self. I am no longer the same kid that would... or...</p><p>I am older and wiser. I&#39;ve put my childish ways behind me and moved on to bigger and better things. At least, so I thought.</p><p>But then Rei and I went into the bubble again and it all came back to me.</p><p>The next night, I couldn&#39;t sleep. I found myself thinking about old inventions I never built or stories I never wrote. All of them stored in a data drive in a cabinet in the bubble.</p><p>So I went back.</p><p>Children are constantly learning about the world around them</p><p>When you are a child, you do childish things. Sometimes, you are fixated on certain objects or places</p><p>But as you grow older, you tell yourself to put the childish things away. You don&#39;t need them anymore. You need to move on to bigger and better things.</p><p>The other day, Rei and I went into the bubble again. It had been ages. I needed a break, so I went back.</p><p>The kelpfolk were (as always) missing in action, so I just made my way there.</p><p>It was still filthy... I thought about asking Jake to help, but this was always my thing.</p><p>Something about how it feels great to accomplish something meaningless when there is so much going on around you. But this place wasn&#39;t alwas meaningless to me.</p><p>There was a time...</p><p>Sometimes teenagers feel the need to be alone. They just need time to do things in secret, away from the rest of society.</p><p>Orange paint for warnings throughout Nemo</p><p>&quot;Well, where else would you be?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What were you doing down there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Writing&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d love to read something one day.&quot;</p><p>Well, hopefully you are reading this. Wherever you are.</p><p>Somehow, no matter what I did, I always felt like you and I were on the same wavelength. It&#39;s something I wish I could replicate with Rei. She&#39;s so much smarter than me, I can barely keep up.</p><p>But maybe that&#39;s how you felt too.</p><p>...</p><p>We are all crazy. Every last one of us. But that&#39;s what makes Nemo work. A bunch of crazy people throwing their lives away to push the boundary of human knowledge forward just a little bit.</p><p>Anyway, I hope you are well.<br/>Lars</p><p>Pete stole one of our old breadboards. Ordinarily, this would be no problem because basically no one uses breadboards nowadays, but apparenrtly <em>that specific breadboard</em> was already all wired up for Rei&#39;s analog drone she has been working on. When She said that she stored the circuit already, so it wouldn&#39;t be hard to replicate, just time consuming.</p><p>The other </p><p>A lesson learned is one you never forget.</p><p>A little while ago, Rei and I had an adventure at night. It reminded me of a similar story between the two of us.</p><section class="footnotes is-size-7"><ul><li class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a class="tag is-link" href="#citeref-1">1</a>The North American Aerospace Defense Command: essentially the folks in charge of tracking all the junk we have in space.</li></ul></section></article><nav class="docs-footer"><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.2.1 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Friday 21 June 2024 10:22">Friday 21 June 2024</span>.
