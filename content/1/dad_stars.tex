\section*{On stargazing}

\noindent Hey Dad,

20 years.
It's been 2 full decades since we had GPS.
I mean, I 100% understand why they can't replace it, but still!
If you are out in the middle of nowhere, what are you supposed to do?
Navigate by starlight? 

You can't even see stars until the space junk is gone a few hours past twilight!
What are we supposed to do in the mean-time?
Sit by while being mauled by boar or bitten by snakes?

I know I sound like a bitter old man right now, but it's because I am one!
You told me stories of all the adventures...

To be honest, though, as much as I hate the satellites, I can still remember going camping with you while young and being frankly amazed at all the light after the sun set.

At some point, on a whim, I decided to take Leia out of school early and do the same.

So, I guess this is the story of our camping trip.
